            <h3>1)FIND GOOD KEYWORDS:</h3>
          <p>First, you need to understand that
              how YouTube decides which videos to rank is based on keywords. People are looking
              for different topics on YouTube and they're also watching videos and seeing
              videos suggested in the sidebar you need to use specific words that people are
              looking for or interested in in your videos title, description and tags so that
              you will show up in the search and on that sidebar and more people will watch
              your video.</p>
              <P>The first step to doing this is to make sure that you find some
              really good keywords that people are actually interested in and actually
              searching for.</P>
              <P>So, first brainstorm a whole bunch of different ideas about what
               people might be searching for think about the real words that people would use
               if they were looking for a video like yours after you've brainstormed a big list
               of words that people might be using then it's time to start doing a little bit
              of research to figure out which of those words are actually the most popular.</P>
              <P>The simplest way to do this is just to start typing these different keywords into
                the search bar on YouTube or on Google when you do this you'll see a bunch of
                suggested searches pop up and these are some of the things that people are
                searching for the most often when you find these terms that people are using a
                whole lot you'll want to make sure that you use those words in your videos title
                description and tags.
                </P>
                <P>Another way to figure out exactly which keywords you should
                be focusing on is to use a free extension called tube buddy-buddy is just a
                browser extension that you can install on whatever browser you're using it will
                give you data on different search terms when you're doing research on YouTube so
                with two buddy installed when I search for a keyword on YouTube I see this
                little box pop up over on the side of the page and it gives me a rank for that
                keyword it tells me how good of a keyword that is based on how popular it is how
                many people are searching for it and how competitive it is.</P>
                <P>Basically you want to
                be looking for keywords that have lots of people searching for them but aren't
                very competitive now the reality is that most keywords that people are searching
                for are going to be fairly competitive so you're just looking to find a good
                balance if you can find one that is moderately popular and moderately
                competitive then that's actually probably a pretty good keyword to go after but
                ideally you're looking for one that is very popular and not very competitive as
                your channel grows in popularity you'll be able to go after more and more
                competitive keywords and you'll be able to get better and better rankings for
                your videos.
                </P>
                <P>When you're just starting out it's better to target those less
                  competitive keywords that maybe aren't quite as popular but at least you'll be
                  able to rank for and start to get some traction on YouTube. </P>

         <div class="seo-content my-5">
            <h3>2)use your competitors video titles as tags:</h3>
          <p>My second tip, is one that I haven't heard anyone talking about so if you do this you will
              definitely be ahead of the game and this is to use your competitors video titles
              as tags on your own video.</p>
              <P>So, when you're doing your keyword research and you're
              looking at these different keywords that you'd like to rank for and the sort of
              videos that if people are interested in them they would also be interested in
              the video that you are making.</P>
          <P>
              So, if you want to do is copy the title of that
              video exactly and then paste it into the tags section of your video and also
              into the bottom part of the description of your video that way when someone is
              watching that video on YouTube your video will be much more likely to show up in
              the suggested video side column and you will get a lot more views because of it
              and if you want to be even more sneaky about it that you can open up a private
              browser in your computer go to the competitors video and then see what videos
              show up in the side column when you're watching their video and you could use
              some of the more popular videos that are popping up on that sidebar as even more
              tags on your own video.</P>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="container">
         <div class="seo-content my-5">
            <h3>3)use TUBEBUDDY extension:</h3>
          <p>Tip number three, is to use TUBEBUDDY  to see what keywords
              your competitors are successfully targeting so whenever you're watching a video
              on youtube and you have two buddy installed over on right hand side you will see
              a list of all of the tags that are on that video and tubebuddy will even tell
              you how well that video is ranking for those different tags.</p>
              <P>So, if you see a
                  video that's really similar to the video that you're making and the channel that
                  made it has a similar number of subscribers as you do and maybe their videos are
                  doing about as well as your videos are normally doing then that gives you a good
                  idea that you can probably rank for those same keywords if you optimize your
                  video around those keywords.</P>
          <P>
              So, if you're making a video about how to train your
              puppy and you go and watch a video that has that tail how to train your puppy
              and you look at the tags over on the side and you see that they are ranking
              number five for the keyword puppy training tips then you know that puppy
              training tips is probably a good keyword for you to go after.</P>

        <div class="container">
         <div class="seo-content my-5">
            <h3>4)use your own name as a tag:</h3>
          <p>Tip number four, YouTube likes to reward creators who keep people on YouTube
              for longer so when someone is watching one of your videos if they then go and
              watch another of your videos right after it then YouTube thinks oh wow this
              channel is doing a great job people are interested in watching more content and
              that means that they are interested in being on YouTube to watch this creators
              content.</p>
              <P>So, if you can do something to make people want to watch more of your
                  videos right after they watch one of your videos then YouTube will actually want
                  to give you a boost in the rankings because they want your channel to do better
                  so it sneaky little way that you can do this is to use your own name as a tag
                  channel name in the tags section of your video.</P>
          <P>
              Here's what this does this means
              that YouTube thinks that your videos are even more closely related to each other
              because it sees that they have these different keywords that are in common so it
              sees that on one of your videos your name is in the tags and in another of your
              videos your name is in the tags and that way when someone's watching one of your
              video your other videos are even more likely to show up in those suggested
              videos which means that someone is more likely to watch one of your videos after
              the video if they're already watching.</P>
              <P>So, not only does this mean that YouTube
                  will favor your channel but it also means that you're getting more views right
                  then and there because people are going to watch more of your videos in a row.</P>
          </div>

            <h3>5)Place tags in tag box and in video description:</h3>
          <p>Tip number five, is also kind of sneaky which makes me feel like maybe I should
              call this Article like sneaky tips to rank number one on YouTube but anyway my
              fifth tip for you is to not only put the tags in the actual tags box where
              YouTube tells you to put your tags but also copy them from there and paste them
              into the very bottom part of your video's description and that way you get all
              of your keywords both into the description and into the tags also rather than
              trying to stuff all those keywords and make them sound natural somehow in the
              video's description.</p>
              <P>You can just put it all the way down at the bottom and just
              write tags and then put a whole list of the tags after that and that way anyone
              sees it they just think oh those are the tags and they won't think twice about
              it.
              </P>

            <h3> bonus tip one:</h3>
          <p>First bonus tip, is just make sure that you keep in mind that main big picture strategy
              which is you want to find keywords that have a high searched volume and low
              competition the more of those keywords you can find the better your videos will do.</p>
            <h3> bonus tip number two:</h3>
          <p>Bonus tip number two, is decide exactly what keywords you're going to go
              after with your video before you film your video so that as you make your video
              you can actually say the keywords in your video because YouTube is listening to
              you their algorithm and software has gotten a lot more advanced and they can
              actually listen to your videos now even if you don't have subtitles or closed
              captions on your video they can still listen to your video at least in part to
              try to figure out exactly what your video is about so if you say your keywords
              in your video of course in a natural conversational way then this will actually
              help your video rank better on YouTube.</p>
