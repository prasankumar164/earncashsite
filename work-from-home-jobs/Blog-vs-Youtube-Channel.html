             <p>Today we're gonna be talking all about <span class="text-warning"> how to decide whether to start a blog (or) a YouTube channel.</span>
            </p>
            <P>Whenever I make a article about Blogging (or) about creating a YouTube channel (or) growing your YouTube channel (or) anything like that I always see so many of you comment and say that
                you're thinking about starting a YouTube channel (or) you're thinking about
                starting a blog and when I've kind of gotten to know some of you a little bit
                better and we've continued this conversation I've heard from you that you're
                interested in starting either one of these things (or) maybe both of them but
                you're not quite sure which one is the right fit for you.
           </P>
           <p>
            So, to start out I'm going to focus on talking about a blog and specifically
            the pros of starting a blog now you'll probably notice that both a blog and a
            YouTube channel have a lot of pros in common there are positive benefits of both
            of them that they both share but then they also each have some unique pros that
            the other one doesn't have.</p>

                         </div>
                    <h2>PROS OF BLOG:</h2>
                    <p>So, <span class="text-warning">the first pro </span>of starting a blog,</p>

               <P>Is that it allows you to share your ideas with the world obviously this is a pro that both
                a blog and a YouTube channel have they both are outlets for your creative ideas
                whether you choose to use them to teach people things or you just are creating
                some sort of entertaining resource for people to consume either way it allows
                you to share your creative ideas with the world.</P>

                <P><span class="text-warning">The second Pro </span>of starting a
                blog is that it is pretty inflexible fun and easy now I know that most loggers
                would probably tell you that writing a blog isn't that easy but on the relative
                scale of things that you can do yes it is hard work but it's not terribly
                complicated so something that pretty much anyone can do it is a very flexible
                way to share your ideas with the world and potentially make some money and it
                also can be really fun because most of the time people start a blog around a
                topic that they're really interested in.</P>

               

                <P><span class="text-warning">The next pro of a blog </span>is that you can monetize it with ads so you can potentially make some money by putting advertisements on your website.</P>

                <P>You also<span class="text-warning"> this is another Pro </span>you can use your
                blog to advertise and sell your products or services so if you have a widget you
                want to sell or if you want to make a course or if you offer some sort of
                service like if you are a web designer or a video editor or a personal assistant
                whatever you do whatever value you want to give to the world you could choose to
                use your blog to actually advertise that service and get customers.</P>

                <P><span class="text-warning">The next pro
                of running a blog </span>is that it's something that you completely own well you are to
                some degree normally relying on some third party services who might be hosting
                your content okay so your content may kind of be living somewhere else you do
                technically own your content it is yours and for the most part you are
                completely in control of it and that's something that's a little bit different
                than a YouTube channel and I'll get into that a little bit later when I'm
                talking about the pros and the cons for the YouTube channel.</P>

                <P><span class="text-warning">Then the final
                pro of the blog </span>is the most obvious one and that is that it's a great choice if
                you love to write because you can share your creative ideas with the world
                through writing.</P>

                <div class="ecom-two-content">
                    <h2>CONS OF BLOG:</h2>
                    <p>Now let's get into these<span class="text-warning"> cons of running a blog </span>because there are definitely a few of them,</p>

               <P><span class="text-warning">The first one</span> is almost in contradiction one
                of the pros that I mentioned and that's about the ads well you can put ads on
                your blog and you can earn money from them the ads on blogs pay very poorly in
                fact you need to have hundreds of thousands of pageviews per month in order to
                make any sort of significant amount of money and even that significant amount of
                money honestly probably won't be more than a couple thousand dollars at most.</P>

                <P>However that's not to say that you can't make a lot of money with a blog there
                    are many opportunities to work with sponsors or to sell your own products on the
                    site that can allow you to turn it into a profitable hobby or even your
                    full-time job.</P>

            <P><span class="text-warning">The second pro </span>of running a blog is that you really have to do all
                the work to generate your own traffic people might happen to find you on Google
                and that certainly happens sometimes but not nearly as much as it used to happen
                about 10 or 15 years ago and even that organic traffic is often earned through
                your hard work.</P>

                <P><span class="text-warning">The next kind of running a blog</span> is that it is extremely
                    competitive there are millions of blogs on the internet these days and so it can
                    be really hard to get your website to stand out to get people to even hear about
                    it and if they do hear about it to get them to visit and to get them to come
                    back for more.</P>

               <P>But we're not doing what the cons get like I said there are a
                few of them the next con is that it doesn't necessarily create a very personal
                connection with the visitors to the site so someone might happen to find you on
                Google they come across your site maybe they want to see a recipe or a fashion
                post that you put together or your review of some sort of gadget they read the
                posts they get the information they need and then they're out of there they
                might never even think about the fact that a real person wrote that article that
                you might have other articles that they might be interested in reading that they
                might be interested in your life you know you look so much more to share with
                them but it can be tough to get them to understand and realize that when they
                just come and read one of your posts  more often than not they just leave after
                they read that post and they never return again.</P>     

                <P><span class="text-warning">The final comment of running a blog</span> is that it can be very time consuming well at first you might think that it would not take very much time to run a blog because you might
                    think okay so this article is you know a thousand words long or so I could
                    probably write that in an hour I want to blog once a week an hour a week that's
                    hardly anything and I completely agree that is hardly anything but the reality
                    is as someone who has blogged pretty consistently for the last five years.</P>

                <P>So, that when you're first starting out you have to invest a whole lot more time
                    than that simply in learning how to do all the different things related to
                    running a blog when I was 20 <span class="text-warning">my blog I was spending about 20 hours a week on my
                    blog</span> about five hours of that every single week was going into writing the posts
                    because sure it only takes about an hour to actually write the post but then it
                    takes several more hours to edit the post to find or create images to go along
                    with the post to put that blog post on your blog format it how you want test it
                    make sure everything's running right there's a lot of steps involved and that's
                    not even including then promoting the post when you're first starting out
                    learning how to do all of those different steps and learning the different
                    software's that you need to actually build the site to hook up your email list
                    all those different things is very time-consuming.</P>   
                    
                    <P>But even once you get out of
                        that initial learning phase the work does not stop because at that point your
                        eyes are opened to all of<span class="text-warning"> the potential opportunities out there ways that you
                        could collaborate with other bloggers,</span> new software that you could learn ways
                        that you could promote your blog even more ways you could make your blog post
                        even better and you start to feel like you need to do all of these things if you
                        really want your blog to be successful and since you already have to put several
                        hours a week in just to make the posts really awesome you feel like you should
                        invest more time into it to make that initial work pay off.</P>

                   <P>So, long story short running a <span class="text-warning">blog is very time consuming </span>now if you just want a little place on the
                    internet to Chronicle some of your adventures or to share some kind of diary
                    entries then you certainly could do that in just a couple hours a week no
                    problem but if you're planning on turning this into a serious hobby into
                    monetizing it or in turning it into a full-time job then I just want to let you
                    know that honestly you should plan for it to take at least 15 to 20 hours every
                    week.</P>

                    <h2>PROS OF RUNNING YOUTUBE CHANNEL:</h2>


                    <p>So, now that we've covered some of the pros and the cons of starting a
                     blog<span class="text-warning"> let's talk about the pros and the cons of starting a YouTube channel</span> and
                     prasan mentioned before a YouTube channel has a lot of pros and cons that are
                     similar to the pros and cons of starting a blog but also some that are different
                     just like starting a blog running a YouTube channel can be really flexible fun
                     and pretty easy again it does take time it does take some hard work but it's not
                     terribly complex you can't of course get more into the film make and videography
                     side of YouTube and in that case that definitely gets a lot more complex and I
                     would say stops being so easy but for most people running a YouTube channel is
                     pretty flexible fun and easy and it can be a flexible fun and easy way to make a
                     living if that's what you want it to be.</p>

               <P><span class="text-warning">The second pro of running a YouTube
                channel</span> is what I'd like to frame a location so whenever you
                have something that you want to settle whether it's a house that you've bought
                your train sale or if you have a business and you're trying to sell a product, if
                you have a good location it is a huge asset to your business and it makes it
                much more likely that your business will be successful.</P>

                <P>Just imagine if you have a hamburger chain and it's on some quiet back road as opposed to if you had a
                    hamburger chain and it was located on a busy street corner okay which one is
                    probably gonna do better it will be a lot easier for the one in the good
                    location to do better because it gets so much traffic and the same thing happens
                    with a YouTube channel unlike a blog that is lost on some back road of the
                    internet your YouTube channel is on a platform that is a very busy with people
                    okay there's a lot of traffic here on YouTube people browsing around just
                    looking for something to watch and YouTube is constantly suggesting YouTube
                    channels to people who they think might be interested in them.</P>

                <P>So,<span class="text-warning"> a definite Pro of a YouTube channel</span> is that you're in a place that already gets a lot of
                    traffic and so you can potentially get a lot of easy visibility you don't have
                    to constantly be working for your traffic.</P> 
                    
                 <P><span class="text-warning">The next Pro of running a YouTube
                    channel</span> goes right along with that and that is that running a YouTube channel
                    can be a pretty fast way to build your audience now there's obviously all sorts
                    of different platforms on the internet and off where people are trying to build
                    up their platform and attract an audience whether you're running a podcast or a
                    blog or a Facebook page or an Instagram page whatever it is you're trying to get
                    visible and build your audience you're trying to have people find out about you
                    and decide to follow you and learn more about what you have to offer and a pro
                    of building a YouTube channel is that it can be one of the fastest ways to build
                    your audience because not only do you get that traffic but people will also feel
                    much more connected to you when they see your face and hear your voice and that
                    brings us.</P>   

                    <P><span class="text-warning">The next Pro of starting the YouTube channel</span> and that
                        is that it can be a great way to build connection and trust with your audience
                        whether or not you already have a blog or you're already trying to build your
                        audience on Instagram or any other platform there is no denying then people see
                        your face and hear your voice they feel much more strongly connected to you they
                        cannot deny the fact that you are a real person who has your own unique
                        personality and unique ideas that you bring to the table and they are much more
                        likely to want to find out more about you and more about what you have to offer.</P>


            <P><span class="text-warning">The next Pro of starting a YouTube channel</span> is actually in direct opposition to
                one of the cons of a blog one of the cons I mentioned of a blog is that the ads
                pay pretty poorly but the ads on YouTube actually pay pretty well now most
                YouTube channels earn about five to ten dollars per thousand views that they get
                on their YouTube channel.</P>    
                
            <P>So, <span class="text-warning">if you have a video that gets a hundred thousand
                views you probably made around five hundred dollars</span> now I know that at first you
                might think well that doesn't sound like that much and I probably won't be
                getting a hundred thousand views on my videos especially when I first starting
                out and that is totally true however as you build up videos on your channel
                you're gonna build up this whole library of content and people are gonna keep
                watching your old videos ever since my channel got to the point where I had
                maybe about 50,000 subscribers and I started having some different videos take
                off my channel has averaged at least around half a million views per month
                across my whole channel and then depending on what nice you're actually in you
                might earn more or less per thousand views that you get in my particular niche
                where I'm making videos about entrepreneurship success and personal development
                I make an average of about ten dollars per thousand views that I get.</P>    
         
                
                <P>So, that five hundred thousand views across my channel that I get every month earns me
                    around five thousand dollars per month now considering that I don't have a map
                    audience it's pretty cool that I can make $5,000 a month just from the ads alone.</P>

                
              <P>Then<span class="text-warning">the final pro of a youtube channel</span> is one that a blog has also and
                that's just that you can also use your YouTube channel to sell your products or
                your services so again if you have a widget that you want to sell or you've
                created a course or you provide some sort of service yourself whether that means
                you're a bookkeeper or a graphic designer or any other sort of service provider
                you can use your channel to show off your expertise and get clients.</P>

                <h2>CONS OF RUNNING YOUTUBE CHANNEL:</h2>

              <p>Now <span class="text-warning">let's talk about the cons of a YouTube channel</span> because there's definitely a few
                 of those also the<span class="text-warning"> first con </span>is that creating YouTube videos can definitely be
                 time-consuming I'd say that on average people spend anywhere from about one hour
                 up to about ten hours to make a single YouTube video however I want to let you
                 know that if you're making videos more like this on or you're sitting down and
                 talking to a camera that normally takes me around two hours if I'm doing the
                 editing myself.</p>

               <P>So, sitting down and actually filming the video takes about half
                an hour and then I spend about an hour editing the video and then another half
                hour creating the thumbnail and actually posting it on YouTube you certainly can
                spend way more time than that if you want to make it into more of a production
                but if you are as making videos more like this type then I think that you'll
                find that it actually takes you less time to make a youtube video then it has to
                write a blog post.</P>

                <P>When I was consistently writing blog posts I would normally
                block out most of a day to get that blog post written and post it on my site
                normally around five to six hours however I can make a youtube video and around
                two hours.</P>

                <P><span class="text-warning">However the fact still is that creating videos is still time consuming</span>
                and I would still consider that a con of running a YouTube channel okay the
                second con of running a YouTube channel is that YouTube is very competitive it
                is not as competitive as the blogging world there are millions of blogs and I
                believe that there are about a tenth the number of YouTube channels as there are
                the number of blogs.</P>

                <P>However both of these things are rather difficult to count
                and I've seen different numbers for both the number of blogs and the number of
                YouTube channels so I can't say for sure but most of the time the numbers that
                I've seen for blogs have been about ten times as many blogs as the number of
                YouTube channels.</P>

                <P>All that to say blogging seems to be more competitive by
                YouTube is still very competitive and you still have to work on doing a good job
                on YouTube making good quality videos making them a super interesting that's
                probably the most important part and also sharing valuable content whether
                that's helpful how-to content or simply really entertaining content long story
                short YouTube is competitive and that is a con of running a YouTube channel.</P>

                <P><span class="text-warning">The final con</span> of running a jib channel and probably the biggest one
                especially in contrast to a blog is that ya don't completely own it now I
                believe that from a technical standpoint you do own your videos that you put on
                YouTube YouTube can't just go out and use your videos for some other purpose no
                one else is supposed to be able to take your videos and go out and use them for
                some other purpose but you are putting them on someone else's platform and so
                YouTube is completely in control of your videos on their platform now hopefully
                you are keeping master copies of your videos that you'll be able to use for
                other purposes if you so choose and you are always welcome to use them for other
                purposes I don't know if you realize this or if most people realize this but you
                can take the same videos that you put on YouTube and you can go and post them on
                Facebook for example and there's no problem with that.</P>

                <P>But whatever videos you put on YouTube you don't have control of that and you certainly don't have
                control of your whole channel or of the subscribers that you attract on YouTube
                and what that means is there is always that potential that something could
                happen to your YouTube channel.</P>

                <P>YouTube could delete it whether that be on
                 purpose or completely on accident and I know people who that has happened to or
                 YouTube could decide that they don't like your content and could choose to
                 abandon youtube now those things are certainly rare but they are a con that you
                 should consider simply put you don't own your YouTube channel.</P>
 
                 <P>So,<span class="text-warning"> now that we've gotten through the list of pros and cons of blogging and YouTube </span>I'm now
                 gonna do a little bit of kind of comparison and contrast of the two platforms
                 and then I'm going to share with you a few questions that you might want to ask
                 yourself to help make this decision.</P>

                <P>So,<span class="text-warning"> Blogging  (vs) YouTube they're both
                amazing platforms </span>where you share your creativity and impact people's lives and
                start to build up your audience they also those are fairly time-consuming and
                fairly competitive they also both allow you to create an income for yourself
                both through ads and through selling your own products or other people's
                products.</P>














                <P>Then <span class="text-warning">let's talk about some of the ways that they're different well
                        long story short,</span> YouTube is a little bit less competitive than blogging is now
                        that's not to say that it's not competitive it definitely is very competitive
                        but it's less competitive than blogging and when someone does find your YouTube
                        channel it's more likely that they'll actually choose to subscribe and watch
                        more of your videos in the future because they're gonna feel a stronger
                        connection with you.</P>

               <P>After working as a consultant with<span class="text-warning"> numerous bloggers and
                    numerous YouTube channels</span> I would say that on average youtubers are able to
                    build their audience about 10 at times as fast as bloggers are and that is a big
                    difference especially when you consider all of the hours that you're having to
                    put into creating the content for either platform you really want to be able to
                    get the biggest impact from that effort that you're putting out.</P>     
                    
             
            <P>So, basically I would say that if you're comfortable on camera or if you're willing to work to
                    become comfortable on camera I probably recommend starting a YouTube channel
                    over starting a blog however if you're someone who loves writing and that is
                    what really appeals to you then that's really the most important thing and in
                    that case start a blog.</P>   
                    
             <P>
                    The only other thing that I want to mention is that
                    as I brought up earlier if you start a YouTube channel you're not gonna be in
                    complete control of it and there is always the possibility that you could lose
                    all that hard work you put into building it but you certainly can mitigate that
                    risk by working to diversify your audience as much as possible and create
                    multiple points of contact with your audience and all I mean by that is that if
                    you are running a YouTube channel I would highly encourage you to ask your
                    subscribers to also follow you on Instagram or most importantly to join your
                    email list.</P>  
                    
                    
              <P>The more points of connection you have with<span class="text-warning"> your audience the more
                    secure your business </span>is going to be okay so finally let's get into some of these
                    questions that you can ask yourself to make this important decision.</P>    
                    
            
             <P>Now<span class="text-warning">first of all probably the biggest question you can ask yourself is just which one would
                    you enjoy more </span>because the hardest part about running either of these two things
                    either a blog or YouTube channel is the place to ticking with it so many people
                    start a blog or start a YouTube channel write a few articles film a few videos
                    and then they just lose their steam and they quit and once you quit it's really
                    hard to get going again and it's also really difficult to build your audience if
                    you aren't being consistent and if you're not doing what you are the most
                    excited about doing it'll be even harder to stick with it.</P>     
                    
                    
            <P>So, <span class="text-warning">if you enjoy writing more (or) if you enjoy making videos</span> more then you'll probably just want
                    to go with whichever thing you enjoy more and the one exception to that that I
                    would make is that if both of them is sound interesting to you if you're open to
                    both ideas then you'll probably want to go with which one makes the more sense
                    for your goals and that brings us.</P>  
                    
             <P>The <span class="text-warning">second question which platform would be better
                    for your goals </span>and in order to answer that question you
                   first have to get clear about what your goals even are so different people have
                   different reasons why they might want to start a blog or start a YouTube channel.</P>       




                   <div class="ecom-two-img text-center mt-3">
                    <img src="../img/workfromhome/youtube-4.jpg" alt="blog or youtube" title="blog or youtube" class="img-fluid">
             </div>

              <P>Maybe you just want to share your ideas and almost use it like a digital diary a
                    digital public diary other people really want to have a big impact on a large
                    number of people still other people might want to just have a big impact on a
                    couple people so some people have a really important idea and they feel like if
                    I could just share this even with a handful of people it would be totally worth
                    it and then finally some people want to use this channel whether it's a YouTube
                    channel or blog this channel of communicating with people to sell their products
                    or sell their services and in that case you have to think about you know where
                    is your audience most likely to be found does <span class="text-warning">your audience prefer reading blog
                    articles or would they prefer watching youtube videos and is it important that
                    you grow your audience faster.</span></P>   
                    

                    
                    <P>Generally if you're selling something more
                            expensive then you <span class="text-warning">just need to attract a few of the right people</span> whereas if
                            you're selling something that is less expensive then you need a very large
                            audience of people who are interested in buying because you need a lot of small
                            transactions.
                            </P>


                    <P>So, I'll have to say you need to think about what your goals for
                            your platform actually are why you're interested in starting a blog or starting
                            a YouTube channel and then think about which of these two platforms is a better
                            suited to help you reach those goals see you.</P>   
                            
                   <P>Next two questions but it's
                        important for you to ask yourself is first of all<span class="text-warning"> how important is it to you for
                        you to grow your audience very quickly</span> because if it's really important for one
                        reason or another for you to grow your audience fast then YouTube is probably
                        the better bet.</P>       
                        
                        


                        <P>Then<span class="text-warning"> the second thing </span>that goes right along with that is how
                                competitive are you and how willing are you to really put in the hard work and
                                is there one type of work that appeals more to you if you're working on building
                                a blog you're really gonna have to dig in to do the collaborations to write the
                                guest posts and to get your name out there whereas if you're over on YouTube
                                then instead you're gonna have to work on making your videos as high-quality as
                                possible so that they really stand out from your competition either way you need
                                to be competitive but it's still something we're thinking about.</P>

         <P>Then <span class="text-warning">the final question I</span> would suggest that you ask yourself is how much time do you
                want to or have available to commit to this project because these two different
                platforms require different amounts of time and also kind of different types of
                time blogging normally takes a little bit more time like I said normally
                would take me around 5 hours to write a blog post and actually get it published
                on the Internet the type of work that's required for blogging though can be
                really slow and steady you can write a few words every day and buy a few words I
                mean probably a couple hundred and then later in the week work on doing the
                different tasks that you need to do to get your blog article published on your
                website with the YouTube channel.</P>

                <P>On the other hand <span class="text-warning">creating each video takes
                        less time </span>generally unless you're creating something that's really complicated
                        however even though it takes less time normally I would say around 2 hours per
                        video you need to do it in kind of bigger spurts because you have to sit down
                        and actually film the video and that can take you time to get ready you know
                        maybe you want to put on your makeup or do your hair sit down film the video
                        start to finish you can't really break that up into little bits unless you're
                        doing daily vlogs fellow content and then once the videos filmed have to do all
                        the editing and you have to get it uploaded onto YouTube and those things are
                        normally easier to do in big chunks.</P>

                        <P>So, <span class="text-warning">if you have tiny little bits of time all
                                throughout the week but you have plenty of them blogging could be a better</span> fit
                                on the other hand if you just have a couple big chunks like maybe you just have
                                Saturday available then a YouTube channel might work better for you.</P>

             <P>well I think that is everything for this Article sorry that it was kind of a long one but
                    I hope that this gave you some thoughts to consider as<span class="text-warning">you're trying to decide
                    whether to start a blog or YouTube channel.</span></P>
