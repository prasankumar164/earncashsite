            </div>
            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2 class="scrap-color">1) SEO: (Get traffic for your blog) :</h2>
            <p>So, first of all you got SEO and that just means <span class="text-warning"> (search engine optimization), </span>search engine optimization means that you're making it easier for search engines to understand what your content is all about so that they know who they should be sharing it with Google is a robot not a human.
            </p>
            <p>So it can't read your article and say oh hey Rahul would really like this so instead what Google does is it uses the keywords that people type into the search bar and it searches articles for those words and tries to find a nice match this is great for both people who are searching Google and for you too if you do it right you need to make sure that you put those words in your article that people would actually be looking for specifically in some key areas such as the title headers and as tags on the images so that <span class="text-warning">Google can understand exactly what your article is about. </span>
            </p>
            
          </div>
          <span class="end"></span>
        </div>
      </div>










      <div id="scrap-two">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="scrap-two-img text-center pt-4">
                <img src="../img/workfromhome/networking.jpg" alt="networking" title="networking" class="img-fluid">

            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2 class="scrap-color">2) networking: (Get traffic for your blog) :</h2>
            <p>Now, let's talk about<span class="text-warning"> the second normal traffic strategy </span>and that is networking so networking just basically means that you're reaching out meeting new people and then you know what different people would be interested in.
            </p>
            <p>So then when you write a piece of content then you're able to say hey Rahul would really like this and you can send it off to Rahul now of course this is a good thing to be doing because if you know that <span class="text-warning">someone would be interested in your piece of content you want to share it with them </span>and they might want to share it with their audience too so that is a great traffic strategy but it's still one of the more normal ones.
            </p>
            
          </div>
          <span class="end"></span>
        </div>
      </div>











      <div id="scrap-two">

                <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/21-PROMOTE-YOUR-CHANNEL.jpg" alt="social media" title="social media" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2 class="scrap-color">3) social media: (Get traffic for your blog) :</h2>
            <p>Finally, the third regular traffic strategy would be using social media now social media is really powerful tool because it's very similar to networking except it's on a bigger scale so instead of just sending your article off to one person you can post it on your social media feed like your Facebook wall or your Pinterest board and a whole bunch of people can see it all at once so you're able to share it with more than one person this saves you a lot of time and can also be a lot more effective because you might get to share it with someone who you didn't even know would have been interested in it.
            </p>
            <p>So, those were the three regular kinds of traffic strategies that you're going to find recommended on Google but what is the problem with those well here it is everyone's doing them.
            </p>
            <P>Every average website is doing those three main things because they're really obvious and they are the practice they create a great foundation for you to build your website on of course you want to make your website easy for search engines and of course you want to share your content with people who would understand it and of course you want to leverage your sharing with social media those things are obvious and they're great but if you just do them then you're not going to be able to stand out and rise above the crowd.</P>
            <P>There is so much competition in the online space there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
           vlogs out there and if you just do the same thing that all the other bloggers are doing then you're not really going to stand out and you're not going to get extraordinary results which is what you need because the average blog doesn't get very much traffic and if you want to get very much traffic you need to do something different so what can you do this different well I've done a lot of research and I looked into what some of the top pro bloggers and very successful online entrepreneurs were doing that really helped them to stand out because you can bet they're not just doing those three regular things.</P>

           <P><span class="text-warning">a) Pat Flynn:</span></P>
           <P>The first person we're going to talk about is Pat Flynn of smart passive income. If you spent any time in the blogging or online marketing space then you've definitely heard of Pat before he is a very friendly man who writes about how to create passive recurring income from blogs niche sites and other media now Pat started a number of years ago when there wasn't so much competition and so he got going pretty easily however he's been able to maintain his presence and even grow it substantially and he is now extremely successful in the blogging
            space.</P>

            <P>So, what helped him rise above the crowd well just this he had a podcast now there's nothing uniquely special about a podcast except that it is a much smaller marketplace compared to Google, on Google all of the web sites in the entire world are being indexed and there is over 1 billion websites currently active that's a lot of competition so if you want to really stand out then you should take a cue from Pat and you should dive into one of those more niche media outlets such as the podcasting world, Pat also managed to use collaboration for his benefit.</P>

            <P>I say that in the nicest way possible because Pat was definitely using it for the benefit of his collaborators also but basically what he did is he developed relationships with a lot of other influencers he helped them out he had them on his podcast he featured them on his blog and he shared their stuff developing those relationships meant that he was able to tap into their audiences and they wanted to share his stuff so it just snowballed and it really helped him become much more successful.</P>


            <p><span class="text-warning">b)Mariah cause:</span></p>
            <p>The next top blogger that we're going to talk about is Mariah cause from  femmetrappriner.Com I've always read
            that and I never knew how difficult it was to say until I tried to film this Article anyway she writes about how to create online courses and she creates courses about how to create online courses so she's very much in the information marketing industry now the key strategy that mariah has used over the past 18 to 24 months to really make her business take off has been to do joint venture webinars so we all know what a webinar is when you hop on the computer and you see a live stream from someone and they teach you a couple things and then they try to sell you something right and you might be like well how does that get you traffic.</p>

            <p>Well this is how first felt they were joint-venture webinars so just like Pat forging those relationships with those key influencers Mariah was able to tap into the audiences of other influencers by doing a collaborative webinar with them and getting the other influencer to promote that webinar to their audience so even if Mariah only had five hundred email subscribers herself by doing that joint-venture webinar she was able to get in front of someone else's audience and maybe they had five thousand email subscribers who they were all being promoted to or maybe they had you know ten thousand YouTube subscribers whatever that other person's main platform was Mariah was able to utilize that and get in front of all those people all those people then signed up for Mariah's email list so that they could get on the webinar and Mariah was unable to promote her content from her website to that much bigger audience.</p>

            <p>So, you see this is how Mirai was able to get a whole lot more people looking at her content and she was also able to sell a whole lot of product along the way she did over half a million dollars last year which was her first year with femmetrappriner.Com </p>

            <p><span class="text-warning">c) Melissa Griffin:</span></p>

            <p>I said at that time next on my list is Melissa Griffin from MelissaGriffin.com now melissa is a motivational vlogger who is more recently started talking more about vlogging and traffic strategy and emails and all of those things that go into online marketing and when she did this it was when her website really started to take off and she started to get a ton more traffic now Melissa says that the key strategy that played the biggest role in her success was Pinterest marketing or Pinterest Sharon now we probably all have a Pinterest account and you might think that it's just a fun place where you pin some really unhealthy recipes that you're probably never going to make and some cute DIY projects that you're definitely never going to do but Pinterest is actually an incredibly powerful tool and almost a machine that you can use to drive traffic to your website now you might be wondering how this works well.</p>

            <p>Basically Pinterest is a combination of a search engine and a social media platform so what I mean by this is there's a search bar up there where you can search you know Halloween treats or you can be following other people on Pinterest and see what they are pinning and you can follow different boards of things you're interested in and see what gets pinned on those boards now the combination of these two things means that content can go viral in a very unique way so what Melissa does is she shares all of her blog content on Pinterest on her boards and she also gets on group boards that have a lot more followers so that her content can get in front of a lot more eyeballs now this is a great strategy and Melissa absolutely swears by it she's actually created a course about how to use Pinterest strategy to get more eyes on your content and if she's not alone there are several other bloggers who are absolutely swearing by Pinterest.</p>

            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2 class="scrap-color">4) AmyPorterfruit : (Get traffic for your blog) :</h2>
            <p>Number four on my list is Amy Porter fruit, AmyPorterfruit has a multi seven-figure business selling courses online and where she gets most of her website traffic is from page Facebook Ads, now a lot of people will tell you that paid traffic just doesn't convert that you shouldn't waste your money on it you should try to buy followers or buy subscribers or buy traffic for your website that that's just vanity metrics but Amy Porterfield will tell you wrong because like I said she has done a whole lot of sales and those people that she bought definitely did convert so why is this why are some people saying it doesn't work and some people are saying well the proof is in the pudding well that's because there are different ways to buy traffic.
            </p>
            <p>One way would be like if you went on Fiverr and bought a whole bunch of traffic or views on your content and that obviously wouldn't work because that would just be robots or maybe people in India who didn't care about your content who are just clicking on it just to get that money now that's obviously not going to it's not going to get you anywhere and that would totally be a vanity metric however the other way that you can use paid traffic is with Facebook Ads now Facebook ads are completely different because you don't have robots clicking on your facebook ads in fact if you do them right you're promoting your valuable content and then people who are actually interested in that will be the people who are clicking on it.
            </p>
            <p>The people who are opting into your list not only are those ads directly driving traffic to your website when the people click on the ad and then visit your website but you are also then able to remark it to them over time every time you come out with a new piece of content you can send it their way and they can come check out your website that will definitely get to more traffic and you can then sell to those people in the future without having to pay to sell to them again so once they've clicked on your Facebook ad opted in to your list then you have their email address and you can contact them for free whenever you want so despite what some naysayers may say Facebook advertising can be a great tool for getting traffic to your website and more customers for your business.</p>

      <div id="scrap-two">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="scrap-two-img text-center pt-4">
                <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/earn-four.jpg" alt="Sonny Leonard doozy" title="Sonny Leonard doozy" class="img-fluid">

            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2 class="scrap-color">5)Sonny Leonard doozy : (Get traffic for your blog) :</h2>
            <p>The final influencer on my list that we could all learn a thing or two from is Sonny Leonard doozy Sonny has a YouTube channel where she talks about creating videos and using videos to market your business and promote your website. now the reason that Sonny says this is a great strategy for getting traffic is because of two things.
            </p>
            

            <p><span class="text-warning">a)YouTube:</span></p>
            <p>YouTube is a great strategy for getting more traffic to your website and the reason that I've decided to start creating more videos myself the first is that video allows you to create a very unique bond with your viewers unlike a blog post where people are just reading the words that you wrote on a page with a video people are actually able to see your pretty face and hear at the sound of your voice this makes people feel much more connected to you and makes them much more interested in what you have to share with them.
            </p>

            <p><span class="text-warning">B)syndicated feed of content:</span></p>
            <p>The second unique thing about YouTube is that it is a syndicated feed of content now what I mean by that is someone might be really interested in your website but it is still a little bit of a hassle for them to have to go to you or specific website to see your content so they might say oh hey so-and-so is my favorite blogger but they might forget to go and visit their blog however on YouTube there's a whole bunch of different content creators who are all putting their content in the same place.
            </p>

            <p>So, it's very convenient for someone to go there and see a whole bunch of content from a bunch of different creators who they really like it makes it more motivating for them to go check out that content on a regular basis and it means that you can get in front of their eyes more frequently.
            </p>

            <p>So, how do you use YouTube to drive traffic to your website well it's pretty simple in your videos you just say hey for more on this topic or if you want to learn more about this you can go check out this article on my website there's a link down below or you can even take it a step further and create some specific actionable piece of content live a checklist or a workbook and put a link to that down in the description and then tell people that they can go check that out and download it, when they go to download it of course they put in their email address which is great for you because you are then able to contact them in the future with offers that they might be interested in or content that they might want to share.</p>

            <p>So, if you want to stand out in the online space if you want to have a successful blog or a very profitable business then you need to do something special you can't just stick to those three regular traffic strategies that everyone else is doing you need to find some unique thing that you can do to direct extra traffic to your website so that you can really get those extraordinary results that you want to have for more information on how to drive traffic to your website and other topics related to how to create and market information products online
                make sure you check out my website regularly.</p>
