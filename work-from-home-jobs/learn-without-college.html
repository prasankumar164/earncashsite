             <h1>10 best highest paying jobs that you can learn (without college) </h1>
             <p>I want to go to college but I don't want crippling student loan debt my family can't afford to pay for my car my family also makes too much for financial aid. What about scholarships what's a scholarship no the ten highest paying jobs that you can get without a college degree now unpopular opinion to some people here but if I could do everything again.
            </p>
            <p>I probably wouldn't have gone to college before you hate me for saying that hear me out College makes a lot of sense if you want to be something like a doctor and it's your passion you love it or for some reason, if you're insane you want to be a lawyer or an engineer or something that literally requires schooling to actually get a job doing it but if you're like I was and you're like how most people are probably don't know exactly what you want to do and college is great for being exposed to new things like calculus classes that you'll never use it all in any part of your life ever we're learning about ancient Mesopotamian history seriously what even is Mesopotamia I feel like that's not even a real place I don't know what to believe at this point and I had a lot of fun in college and I learned a lot of completely irrelevant things to the real world.</p>
            <p>If I could do it all again I probably wouldn't have gone to college because that would have meant that I could have started my business five years sooner so let my mistakes be your potential time savings and I'm not saying don't go to college under any circumstances I'm saying think before you make a choice because the worst-case scenario is just going to college not knowing at all what you want to do just to get some job that you hate only to figure out that you wish you would have worked for yourself from the beginning.

              <p class="pt-5">So, don't waste years to learn that you want to work for yourself and work on your own hours and make money for yourself only weighs 12 minutes on this video  waste your time on me I'm a good waste there's one universal constant in this world and that is time we all have the same amount of time yet some of us are millionaires or multimillionaires or even billionaires and some of us live out on the streets.
              </p>
             <p>So, why is that well the answer is some people focus on the right things and some people don't so let's get into what the right things actually are and remember the of these jobs is to save money and learn so that you can actually use that money to invest in yourself and invest into a business so that you can eventually work for yourself.</p>
             <p>The last thing I want to say it before we actually dive into the list is that some of these jobs do require a high school diploma and many also require on-the-job experience of course which makes complete sense but I know inevitably I'm gonna get some comments on this article that says prasan you told me that I could get this job fresh out of the womb without working for a single second with my eyes closed no I did it I said that they don't require our college degree so shout out to CNBC for making up this list make sure you check out their blog sometime and without further ado let's get into number ten.

            <h2>4) power distributor and dispatcher :</h2>
            <p>With a median annual salary of over eighty-six thousand four hundred and ten dollars this is our highest paid position we've seen yet and I don't know about you guys but I'm really starting to sense a theme here a lot of power-oriented jobs in this list maybe it's like the more power you have the more money you make or maybe it's the more money you have more power you have or maybe electricity equals money.              
          </p>
          <p>So, if I want to get rich all I have to do is just kidding kids don't do it stay in school I'm not sure what that has to do with school but it just felt like the right thing to say right there so basically what these guys do is a lot of things with power and substations and you know big words that make me feel dumb like voltage transformers and substation converters and so since I don't really know what any of that means I'm just gonna pretend that you know I'm smart and wear my glasses oh wait not these glasses.

            <p>With a median salary of seventy-nine thousand seven hundred and eighty then maybe being an elevator operator might be the perfect job for you now we all know elevators and escalators are incredibly important I would personally move out of my house tomorrow if we didn't have an operational elevator because there is literally in no way that I'm actually going to climb my out of shape but up 20-plus flights of stairs every single day but these are the guys who fix and maintain and install elevators and escalators and all types of machinery apparently that start with the letter e but because this job actually does carry some potential danger with it like installing a faulty elevator that falls and crashes and everyone dies you do actually have to do a four-year apprenticeship program with significant ongoing on-the-job training.
