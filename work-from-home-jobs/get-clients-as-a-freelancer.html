             <h1>HOW TO GET CLIENTS AS A FREELANCER (MAKE MONEY ONLINE)</h1>
             <p>Today's Article we are talking about making money online and specifically this Article focuses on how to get clients who will pay you for whatever offer you have for them I have previously made article about jobs and works you can do online so please check out those articles the thing is my experience in working from home is about freelancing. 
            </p>

            <P>Freelancing is a very broad term used for a number of services and lists all those services here so that you can check it and understand which service you can offer and even before we get to the next step which is getting clients to pay you you must remember that you have to get results to your clients whatever you promise you must be efficient at delivering what you offer because otherwise it's a scam so if you are confident that there's a
                skill that you have if there's no skill that you have you can still build it online there's so much free content
                available guys you just need to get started. </P>

             <span class="end"></span>
         </div>
     </div>
   








     <div class="index-two">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="index-two-img text-center">
                    <img src="../img/workfromhome/HOW-TO-GET-CLIENTS-AS-A-FREELANCER-(MAKE-MONEY-ONLINE).jpg" alt="HOW TO GET CLIENTS AS A FREELANCER (MAKE MONEY ONLINE)" title="HOW TO GET CLIENTS AS A FREELANCER (MAKE MONEY ONLINE)" class="img-fluid">
           </div>
            <h2>A) GET CLIENTS AS A FREELANCER (mainly three things)</h2>
            <P>So, the number one thing is obviously to have a skill that the market needs and once you have that you can easily go ahead to the next step which is the major part of today's Article that is how to get clients who will pay you and pay you good money if you want an estimate of how much you can make by freelancing working from home you can easily make fifty thousand to one lakh per month. </P>

            <P>If you are dedicated enough and even much more than that and even much less than that if you don't work much so it really is a variable spectrum and only your hard work and also to some extent how the market place is right now is going to determine how much you make but trust me when I say this freelancing is one of the best things to do today number one because you don't really have to go outside how much which I think takes up a lot of time energy and money in traditional jobs.
            </P>

            <P>So freelancing is definitely a great option for those who don't like that part now if you watch YouTube videos or read articles all of them will suggest you to go on up work, fiber, or freelancer to get jobs don't do it why because these websites have such low rates like there are people working for one, two dollars and I'm like that's that's really low for the services that they are offering and if you are working in a place where there's a competitor offering lower prices than you most of the times people
                are going to go for lower prices and even if they don't the number of people who come to you is going to be less.</P>

            <P>Because there is a huge pool of market and unless you have started before and you already have ratings and
                all that it's going to be very hard for you to establish Authority also at the end of the day upwork, fiber and freelancer are external things that you have to depend on for getting work,</P>    


              <P>So, just don't go in that Lane charge your prices charge proper prices according to the industry rates because I really believe that if you charge low prices you'll have to walk a lot more to meet the same money goal that a person who is charging more reaches much faster than you without working as much hard and you should you really don't need to work very hard just make sure whatever you are working on you do it efficiently.</P>

     <div class="index-two">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="index-two-img text-center">
                    <img src="../img/earning-category/e-commerce.jpg" alt="FIRST THING (getting clients as freelancer)" title="FIRST THING (getting clients as freelancer)" class="img-fluid">
           </div>
            <h2>1) FIRST THING (getting clients as freelancer):</h2>
            <P>The first thing that you need to remember if you want to get clients is get visible get visible get visible people need to know you to buy from you people need to know who you are people need to trust who you are and people need to like you are as well so the reason why I am able to get my jobs and works and you know gigs is mostly because people already know me they know who I am they know what I do and if they need any help in that area they come to me which is why I have a lot of opportunities to work in and I am able to reject some of them too but when you are getting started it must not be that easy you will get a few chances and you should grab on to those opportunities. </P>

            <p>Just because you need to build a portfolio you need to show what you can do to your other clients who are going
                to come later so grab whatever opportunity you can and showcase it on your profile or on a website if you can
                invest in a website websites don't cost as much I think I got my helidoorson website for just 200 rupees or so so it was really really cheap so websites don't cost as much but again that's not mandatory when you get visible on social media in your niche and people who need your service need you they are going to come for you what you to think about something right now who is your ideal client and do they know you already most of you guys who
                come to me and ask me how to get work I see that you've not worked much on your social media and that's not a crime.</p>


            <p>If you're starting working optimize your social media our world is an ocean there's so much opportunity out there
                and if you're not utilizing it it's not anyone else's fault but yours so the first thing I want you to do is get
                visible on social media post content regularly which will add value to your target audiences life and which will
                bring in people who are looking to hire some people like you.</p> 
                
               
              <p>I make book related content on this channel so my content attracts readers as well as authors and authors are the people who are likely to hire me to hire my marketing services to use my channel to promote their book etc
                so they know me they know who I am they are attracted to my channel and that means I don't really have to do
                anything extra then posting content which is a big part it's I agree that it's a huge part of working online
                and you don't really get paid as heavily for it as you should but if you leverage that content making properly it can make you so much money.
                </p>  

                <p>So, the first and the most important thing that you can do to get clients to get high-quality high-paying clients is get visible and I know you might be intimidated if you are not comfortable in front of camera you
                    might be intimidated if you are shy but you really need to do this if you want to get good high quality clients.
                    </p>

           </div>
            <h2>2) SECOND THING (getting clients as freelancer):</h2>
            <P>The next step will be to engage in Facebook groups and let me tell you engaging in Facebook groups has particularly helped me in getting international clients because I am visible to an Indian audience max my international outreach is probably about 10% of the whole channel so it's not as much definitely I have worked with international clients because of my channel as well but it's really less compared to the Indian masse
            so to attract international I went in Facebook groups and I added so much value as much value as I can and I
            still do and Facebook groups do get me a lot of international clients the pay is better if you are working for an international clients because as you know international clients have more money to spare than Indians usually and although I don't personally work with more than two or three international clients at the same time because there's this timeframe thingy and staying awake at night sometimes really gets to me and I don't want to overwork myself still in college so I have to handle that part of my life as well so it's realatic. </P>
            
           <P>But it really helps in helping me meet my income goals and this really helps me in not worry about the other part of my life which brings me money which is youtubing because youtubing is so unstable I can't even tell you it can be 5,000 in a month it can be 50,000 and on so I just don't want that headaches exactly why i leverage facebook groups to interact note that you can also leverage LinkedIn I am still learning LinkedIn but those of my friends who have leveraged LinkedIn they tell me that they get the best types of clients there I personally don't have as much experience in LinkedIn as yet that's exactly why I told you only about Facebook groups but I know that LinkedIn also helps I'm pretty sure you'll find other videos elaborating that.
            </P>

            <h2>3) THIRD THING (getting clients as freelancer):</h2>
            <P>Last tip that I will give you which is the worst tip in these three the first step was getting visible and this was the best tip because you don't really need to go to people and tell them hey do you want to buy from me or hey do you wanna hire me this is the worst part I think for any freelancer when you have to like individually ask people and you get rejected.</P>
            
           <P>I don't really have to do that now because now I get clients automatically because my channel is attracting them but at a certain point of time I used to have to go to people and ask them if they are interested in working with me and most of them would say no some of them would this would say maybe and only a few of them would say
            yes and that is the totally normal thing that happens so if you are just starting off it's okay if you cold call or cold email cold email preferably cold calling is not as preferable for most people if somebody cold calls me in the middle of the day when I'm working and asked me if I want to buy their service or product I'm probably gonna go through the phone and like hit their head because you really need to know someone's schedule to be able to cold-call but you can send them cold emails. 
            </P>    

            <P>So, what do you do in cold emails you tell them that you've seen what they do you tell them how you can help them and you attach some proofs of your service in your previous work or from your previous client you can add some testimonials from your previous clients and this will help your particular client understand if they need your service or not but cold emailing is definitely the worst thing to do among all these three I personally have never had luck with cold emailing as yet I have tried it very less though I've I think I've sent less
            than ten emails cold emails I mean but it's never worked out for me I've never gotten a reply back as yet I think I am yet to master that art of cold emailing but there are a lot of people who do get success with cold emailing but personally I have never heard that and I that's why I won't suggest it to you but you could still give it a try because everyone is different and your client base is different and maybe you have some luck there.
                </P>

            <h2>This three things you need to do if you want to get clients online As a freelancer </h2>
            <P>The three things that you need to do if you want to get clients online I promise this is much better than up work, fiber and freelancer please just don't go to those places and undervalue yourself if you undervalue yourself your time no one else is gonna value it for you no one else also if you're just getting started if you don't have any social proof please work for free for someone ask a friend or family member to let you work for them for sometimes your first paying client will need some proof because they need to trust you and usually if you don't have that proof you're not gonna get high.</P>
            
           <P>This is one of the most important things you need to remember when you're freelancing there are going to be so many people who are going to want free things from you who are going to want to make you work for free there are people like that trust me so if you are doing that too much it will not help so I advice you to start valuing your time number one from today onwards and I promise that you will be seeing results.
