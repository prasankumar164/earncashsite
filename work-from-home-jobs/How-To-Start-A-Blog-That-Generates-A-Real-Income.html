             <p>Today we're gonna be talking about How To Start A Blog That Generate A Real Income,</p>

            <p>I've been blogging for oh! I don't know exactly I
              feel like <span class="text-warning"> I started blogging actually kind of at the tail end of high school (or)
              early college </span>so seven years now eight years that I've been blogging but I
              definitely did not make any money at it for the first five years (or) so it's only
              been in the last three years that I've really started making money from my blog
              and there was a lot of different reasons for that I was not consistent I didn't
              know why I was blogging I didn't know how to make money with a blog but I've
              learned a lot over these past few years since I've started making money from my
              blog and I mean I guess I learned a lot even before that but it's only really
              come to fruition and I've only figured out how to put it all together in these
              last few years.

                and we're gonna talk kind of about the basics of setting up a blog but also what

                have it be a time-consuming hobby.

                <img src="../img/workfromhome/blog-7.jpg" alt="What will you offer" title="What will you offer" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2>1)  What will you offer :</h2>
            <p>The absolute <span class="text-warning">first thing </span> you need
              to do before you even you domain name or set up your blog at all is you need to
              figure out why people would read your blog because if you don't know why people
              would read your blog then other people won't know either and they won't read
              your blog and you won't know how you're helping them and you won't know how to
              turn it into something that is making money so there's a lot of reasons that you
              need to figure this out and for some of you it might be really easy to figure
              out you might know exactly why someone would read your blog.
            </p>

            <P>Maybe <span class="text-warning">you're
              thinking of starting a healthy desserts blog and so you know people would read
              your blog because they want to be healthy </span>and they like dessert right but for
              others of you you might have a much more vague idea especially if you are
              thinking of starting a lifestyle blog or a money blog or something like that and
              you're not sure exactly what people would be getting out of it so if that
              happens to be your situation especially if you are thinking about starting a
              lifestyle blog or a money blog one of the main things that you might consider
              that people are getting out of your blog or a reason why people would read your
              blog is because they're looking for someone who they can relate to and they're
              looking to not feel alone essentially.</P>

              <P>So, they want to know that there are other
                moms out there who are like them (or) other college students who are like them and
                they just want to feel not so much alone the other reason why they might want to
                read a blog like that is for inspiration maybe you're going to inspire their
                style (or) inspire them to live a better life through how to type articles (or)
                maybe you're just gonna inspire them because they'll see how you're living and
                they'll see how you are using style in your life (or) how you are a living of life
                that seems to them to be better (or) more organized (or) something like that and
                though<span class="text-warning"> they might read your blog for one of those reasons.</span>
                </P>

            <h2>2) why someone would read your blog :</h2>
            <p>The next thing you need to do once you've figured out why someone would read your blog is
              you need to brainstorm a whole bunch of content ideas.
            </p>

            <P>Now the reason that I want
              you to do this is two fold <span class="text-warning">the first thing is</span> because I want you to have a lot of
              ideas at your disposal so that you're not wondering you know what should you
              write about and you're not feeling like you don't have enough ideas but then the
              other reason so that you can refine and organize your ideas so that you can
              really polish with gonna be on your blog and it won't be so messy right when you
              first start out if you brainstorm all these ideas then you'll be able to sort
              them into different categories and maybe decide to not do some ideas that at
              first you were kind of interested in they weren't at the top of your list but
              the team like pretty good ideas but then when you see them with all the other
              ideas you'll realize that they don't really fit.</P>

              <P>So, that's why it's a good idea
                to start with <span class="text-warning"> second step </span>by brainstorming a bunch of ideas and then
                organizing them into categories and deciding which ones you're actually gonna
                use on the blog and which ones should probably go in the trash.

            <h2>3) start your blog :</h2>
            <p>Then step number three is the thing that we all think we need to do to start a blog
              and that's actually set up the blog so there's a number of different things that
              you need to do in order to get your blog up and running this article 
            </p>

            <P>but for now I just kind of want to run through the
              list, </P>

              <p class="text-warning">A) hosting:</p>

              <p>first off you need hosting hosting is basically a service that has your
                blog on it so that people from all over the world can go online and access your
                blog on this server,</p>

              <p class="text-warning">B) domain name:</p>

              <p>The second thing you'll need is a domain name and that's
                just your web address so like earnmoneylikepro is my domain name.</p>

              <p class="text-warning">C) install WordPress:</p>

              <p>The third thing you need to do is install WordPress that's what most people use at least
                you don't have to there are some other options but WordPress provides so many
                options is very flexible and it's completely free so that's what most people use
                for their blogs and for a lot of other types of websites too.
                </p>

              <p class="text-warning">D)choose A theme:</p>

              <p>The fourth thing
                you need to do is choose a theme and this is kind of like a template for the
                decorations of website so as you are making your website look a certain way is
                this going to give you a framework so that you're not coding things from scratch.
                </p>

              <p class="text-warning">E)email marketing service:</p>

              <p>The fifth thing you need to do not everyone does but I highly recommend it
                especially if you want to make money with your blog and that's to sign up for an
                email marketing service now you probably aren't going to be marketing anything
                right away but an email marketing service will just allow you to collect the
                email addresses of the people who are reading your blog and that way you'll be
                able to reach out to them on a regular basis remind them about your blog share
                new blog posts and really build a relationship with them.
                </p>

              <p class="text-warning">F)design your blog:</p>

              <p>The step 6 is to actually design the blog itself so now that you have these five different
                components you need to put them all together and actually design your blog so it
                looks how you want and so you can start putting content on it okay so that
                brings us to the end of step three which is set up your blog.

            <h2>4)start blogging: </h2>
            
            <p>Step four
              is to start blogging so <span class="text-warning"> this is where you're actually going to be writing blog
              posts</span> and then putting them onto your website a lot of you might really enjoy
              the process of designing the blog and making it look how you want but for all
              the rest of you who just thought that that was a hassle this is probably the
              part that you're really excited to get into which is actually writing the blog
              posts after you've written a few blog posts you're going to probably want some
              people to start reading them.

            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2>5)drive traffic:</h2>
            
            <p>Step number five is to <span class="text-warning"> drive traffic to your
              blog </span>now it used to be that this step kind of took care of yourself and I'm
              talking a number of years ago when the internet was still relatively new and
              there weren't that many blogs out there and Google had just started people would
              just write blog posts and then they would get found organically on Google and so
              all that really mattered was SEO and making it so that Google could figure out
              what your blog post was about now these days you might get a little bit of
              traffic from SEO in fact you might get a lot of traffic but that's not
              guaranteed at all and so you really have to go out there and be proactive about
              getting the traffic.
            </p>

            <p>Now for my blog and for a lot of other bloggers that I know
              the <span class="text-warning">best sources of traffic have been Pinterest and YouTube.</span></p>

              <p>Now I feel like
                  <span class="text-warning">YouTube </span>is fairly self-explanatory I mean I make videos you guys know that of
                course and then sometimes I share about a blog article on my website that has
                additional resources or that you could go to learn more about whatever I'm
                talking about and then that means that people go and they visit my blog and I
                know a whole lot of blog traffic that way.</p>

                <p><span class="text-warning">Pinterest </span>might not be quite as
                  obvious but basically people create images like the sort of pins that you see on
                  Pinterest and they put them in their blog posts and then they pin those images
                  onto Pinterest now it gets a little bit more complicated than that okay actually
                  it gets a lot more complicated than that if you want to actually get any real
                  traffic from Pinterest. once you are actually
                  getting traffic and just a word of warning that step is the one that takes the
                  longest sometimes it starts working right away but a lot of the times you do
                  have to kind of test different things and figure out something that works for
                  you and what the best thing for your blog is but once you have a system that is
                  working well and you're really getting traffic then it's time.</p>

                    
          </div>
          <span class="end"></span>

      <div id="scrap-two">

                <img src="../img/workfromhome/blog-5.jpg" alt="engage with your audience" title="engage with your audience" class="img-fluid">

            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2>6)engage with your audience:
            </h2>
            
            <p>Step number six step number six is to<span class="text-warning"> engage with your audience</span> now there's a lot of
              different ways you can do this but basically all it means is you've got these
              people coming to your website they read an article and then they might just
              leave probably they'll just leave and they'll completely forget about you and
              they'll never even think about your blog again even if they thought the article
              was great it's just that there's so many distractions in today's world and
              there's so many different things competing for their attention.
            </p>

            <p>So, if you want to
              build a lasting relationship with them and actually be able to help them more in
              the future and actually my name is your blog then you need to engage with them
              now the main two ways to do this are through emails so like I said before I want
              you to be collecting their emails you can just put something on your website
              that says subscribe to the blog or you can offer them some fun freebie for
              signing up but however you do it you want to be collecting their emails and then
              you want to email them on about a weekly basis.</p>

              <P>To really just continue to build
                that relationship to <span class="text-warning">share your new blog posts with them </span>so that you can get to
                know them better and they don't forget who you are and then of course the other
                way that you can do it is on social media you can choose whatever your favorite
                social media platform is something that has kind of an update type feature so
                like Instagram or Facebook or maybe Twitter and then you want to just be sharing
                with them on a regular basis share new articles with them of course but also
                share the behind-the-scenes and what's going on in your life.</P>

      <div id="scrap-two">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="scrap-two-img text-center pt-4">
                <img src="../img/workfromhome/blog-6.jpg" alt="How can YOU ADD MORE VALUE" title="How can YOU ADD MORE VALUE" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2>7)How can YOU ADD MORE VALUE:
            </h2>
            
            <p>Step number seven is where you actually get into the making money part although make
              sure you don't try to skip to step seven a lot of people do if they're focused
              on how to make money with a blog they just try to skip to step seven which is
              <span class="text-warning"> basically figure out how to make money</span> we'll get more into that in just a moment
              but steps one through six every single one of them is so vital because those
              steps really lay the foundation for being able to make money and if you try to
              skip any of those steps then making money with your blog just will not work and
              you will feel really frustrated and you'll waste a lot of time try and do
              something that just isn't gonna happen.              
            </p>

            <p>so step seven I said it was
              basically figuring out how to make my name is your blog what the step is 
              decide how to help your audience further so way back in step number one you
              decided (or) you figured out why someone would read your blog in the first place
              so maybe they want to get healthy and they like desserts okay that's <span class="text-warning">
              plenty
              enough reason for someone to be reading your blog </span>and now in step seven you're
              gonna figure out how can you take this a step further that's what they want how
              can you give them even more how can you be even more helpful.</p>

              <P>So, in that instance
                maybe the answer would be to publish a cookbook of your top dessert recipes and
                a lot of bloggers go the e-book route whether it's actually an e-book (or) they
                decide to self publish a paperback copy of their book but there are a few other
                options too some of the most popular other options include creating an online
                course offering services (or) recommending products now which one you choose can
                depend on a lot of different things it can depend on what you feel like making
                (or) doing it can also depend on what you're helping with your audience with you
                know what type of value you're giving to them it might really lend itself to a
                course versus an e-book (or) to offering a service versus writing an e-book for
                example and then it also might depend on what type of content your audience
                really enjoys consuming (or) what they are wanting from you.</P>

                <P>So, for example if you are a fashion blogger then the very best way that you can help people might
                    <span class="text-warning">   simply be to recommend products a lot of fashion bloggers</span> make most of their
                  money from<span class="text-warning">affiliate Commission's</span> which is just when a blogger or anyone
                  recommends a product and they give you their unique link for that product and
                  then if you go and buy that product then they get a small cut of the sale.</P>

                  <P>Whereas on the other hand if you have a blog for photographers about photography
                    then the best way you could help your readers might be to create an online
                    course for them about how you edit your photos.</P>

                    <P>So for step number seven you need
                      to figure out how you can help your audience further and mostly that has to do
                      with what value are you gonna give them that will help them further but then
                      also you need to decide what form that value will take so will it be an e-book
                      will it be a course will you be recommending products or will you be offering a
                      service.</P>

      <div id="scrap-two">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="scrap-two-img text-center pt-4">
                <img src="../img/workfromhome/blog-7.jpg" alt="Show your readers how to get what they want" title="Show your readers how to get what they want" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2>8) Show your readers how to get what they want: </h2>
            
            <p>Step number eight is simply to
                <span class="text-warning">  show your audience how the product can help them</span> and so I've phrased this step
              very carefully because I think that a lot of us might just immediately feel like
              we're trying to set something and oh no I'm not good at sales or I don't know
              much about marketing but it really doesn't have to be complicated once you've
              already done all that foundational work of you know building your blog and
              getting the traffic so you actually have the audience and you're connected with
              them and you have a relationship with them then there's already that trust there
              they already like you they already know that you have valuable things to share
              with them.          
            </p>

            <p>So you just need to show them how this latest thing whatever it is
              whether it's an e-book whether it's a product whatever it is you just need to
              show them specifically how it helped them and why they would want it and you can
              do that over a series of emails (or) through a series of blog posts (or) videos but
              just show them how it would help them how their life would be different after
              they you know completed the course (or) if they bought the product and then tell
              them about how to buy it also the staff Kelly doesn't need to make you feel
              weird (or) slimy (or) salesy because they're only gonna buy it if they want whatever
              the result is that would happen if they bought it and so it's just your job to
              give a good representation you know what they're getting what the value is there
              and then they can decide for themselves whether (or) not they want that value and
              if they do then that's actually fantastic for both of you because <span class="text-warning"> they're
              getting something that they want</span> like they're being helped you're helping them
              and you're getting paid in the process.
              </p>

              <P>all right so that summarizes the eight
                steps that you need to follow if you wanna start a blog that makes money now
                before I go there's just a couple more things that I want to address.</P>

                <P><span class="text-warning">first of
                  all </span>something that a lot of people bring up when they are interested in starting
                  a blog that makes money is they asked me what about Google AdWords you know or
                  they you know they ask should <span class="text-warning">I put Google AdWords on my site is that a way to
                  make money with a blog </span>because there's a lot of articles out there that say that
                  that's how you make money with a blog is you put ad on your site and then people
                  click on them and you get paid when someone clicks on your ads and that used to
                  be an okay to make money when the internet was less competitive when people
                  weren't so oversaturated by advertisements they were more likely to click on the
                  ads and the ads paid better but these days I would not recommend putting ads on
                  your site in fact that would be the last thing I would suggest you would ever do
                  because first off there's a million blogs out there and so if you want to stand
                  out your blog needs to be fantastic and if you're cluttering it up with ugly ads
                  then that is immediately downgrading the appearance and the quality of your site
                  so definitely not something you want to do.</P>

                  <P><span class="text-warning">Second of all</span> it's really hard to
                    make money with those ads actually people don't click on them very much anymore
                    I mean still millions of clicks but comparatively to how much they used to they
                    don't click on them very frequently because there's so many ads out there and
                    when they do click you only get a few pennies so<span class="text-warning"> you have to have literally
                    hundreds of thousands of visitors to your site to make much money from those ads</span>
                    at all and if you do have that many visitors you could be making so much more
                    money through any of the other ways that you can make money with the blog by
                    selling services or by selling a product or by recommending products you could
                    just make so much more money so many other ways and for most small bloggers who
                    are just getting started or who have a small audience you'd literally be making
                    less than a couple hundred bucks a month and probably a lot less than that so
                    it's just really not worth it and I would not recommend putting ads on your site.</P>
