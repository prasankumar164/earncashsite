             <p>Hey everyone this is rahul I hope you're having a fantastic day today if you've ever searched for things like <span class="text-warning"> how to become a freelance writer</span> how to get started with freelance writing you'll see that tens of thousands of people per month are searching for this topic but if you look at websites like zip recruiter you'll see the average hourly pay ranges a ton you have <span class="text-warning"> freelance writers making $5.00 per hour </span> and on a flip side you have <span class="text-warning"> freelance writers making you know hundreds of dollars for their articles </span> clearly it's a volatile industry and the question we're gonna answer today is how you can become a freelance writer without any experience how you can land higher paying writing jobs as well as some useful resources and tips and tricks you can use to make the journey a little bit easier now further ado let's get to the Article,
            </p>
            <p>
                Freelance writing in some capacity for about the last three to four years I started in college as a ghost writers on my college side hustle in late 2019 I started trying to get more serious with writing and I started getting clients while I was still working a full-time job in 2020. I actually made the jump and started writing full-time in the finance niche I actually moved down to Columbia for a bit I was writing down there and point is it's been about 3 to 4 years to build up to this point and I'm gonna share some realistic expectations you
                should have when deciding to go into freelance writing as well as how you can make the process faster so let's get to the steps,

            <h2>1) pick a niche when it comes to freelance writing:</h2>
            <p> <span class="text-warning">The first step: </span> Is that you're gonna want to pick a niche when it comes to freelance writing this is probably the most important step for actually becoming a freelance writer because it kind of sets the tone for how the next few years are gonna play out and what you're actually gonna be writing about. I completely understand at the start if you feel like you have to say yes to absolutely everything and you <span class="text-warning"> maybe you're tight on cash so you need to accept any project that comes your way.</span>
            </p>
            <p>But over time the idea is really to specialize and to become an expert in a certain niche this is important for a few reasons firstly your writing and Google and the <span class="text-warning">whole space is more competitive</span> than it's ever been and the only way to realistically <span class="text-warning">get decent paying writing jobs </span>is if you can prove that you're an actual expert in your field but picking a niche my recommendation is to use any certification or work experience you have to assert the fact that you're an expert on what you're writing about <span class="text-warning"> for example if you have a nursing degree writing about healthcare content might not be a bad idea.</span>
            </p>
            <p>I write about personal finance because I run a personal finance blog spent the last two and a half years getting myself involved in this nature and you should also play to your strengths I don't write about investments or mortgages because I'm 23 me writing about you know retirement planning or mortgages just doesn't make a whole lot of sense you can write for multiple niches I know plenty of writers who write for finance and travel websites because there's a crossover there you know travel credit cards or mile hacking but the key here is when starting out pick a niche play to your strengths and make sure you can back up that you're an expert by using some work experience or accreditation to give you a leg up over the competition that.

            <h2>2) start building a portfolio :</h2>
            <p>
              <span class="text-warning"> The second Step:</span> For becoming a freelance writer even if you don't have any experiences to <span class="text-warning"> start building a portfolio </span> this is probably what freaks people out the most about freelance writing or people really struggle to
                find their footing honestly I get like five to six emails a week of people asking to guest post on this online
                world to help build their writing portfolio to just write for my site this is honestly the freelance writing
                equivalent of going to a job with a blank resume and it boggles my mind that this is tell a thing I built up my portfolio by starting a blog and it took about a year and a half for my blog to start getting a bit of traction and notice this isn't exactly realistic for everybody but there's nothing stopping you from writing right now and not having to wait your bag for guest posts from random websites now I've mentioned medium.com tons of times you can start writing on medium at your work published in a major publication on medium and seen by thousands of people and use that as your portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>Well I actually created a portfolio website for my freelance writing services it's very out of date but as you can see I have <span class="text-warning"> medium.com </span> listed on my portfolio and it shows the publication's my work has been featured and this could all be done for free this is a free website theme I wrote on medium for free and I got into those publications for free nothing is stopping you from doing this you can build your portfolio on your own and you don't have to go out pitching people for guest posts so now that you've picked your niche and you have some published work on medium.com or maybe a blog it's time for you to start pitching other client there's a few ways to go about this and there's definitely a wrong way and a right way and I've learned both kind of the hard way I'm actually going to share an article from my friend Clint on how he pitches new clients in terms of freelance writing work honestly Clint's an amazing writer I owe him so much he runs the blog wallet wise guy and I currently write as a freelance writer for and he lists you know all of the awesome websites he's writing for you can say hey I'm writing on medium or maybe a few of these sites if you already had a few guest posts he then states what he writes about and when he has a passion for so personal finance credit cards you know things out pertain to his niche. </p>
          <p>The niche of the website he's pitching I would be willing to write one trial article for you to demonstrate the excellence and attention to detail that I can provide for your team below are a few writing samples as well as a link to my hired me pay and then he goes on to link you know things to his blog or other websites he's written for that again retained really well to the knee she's pitching he's not pitching a finance website and then showing examples of his writing for pets or something random wrap it up he says if you need to hire a freelance writer now or sometime in the near future I'd love to be your guy thanks for your consideration claim I'm gonna break down a few quick points here because this is honestly the perfect way to go about introducing yourself to a new editor or editorial team firstly Clint is brief you know he doesn't ramble on about how great he is as a writer even though he very very good writer secondly he also clearly understands.</p>
          <p>The websites he's pitching I mean I've seen examples where people pitch me and they say something like hi admin I'd like to write about X and it's not even that related to my site and they clearly haven't even read my site because if they scroll to the bottom of an article you'll see my name's rahul not admin it just shows a complete lack of research in the fact that you haven't taken the time to do a bit of digging figure out what the sites actually about obviously larger sites aren't gonna have their names everywhere it's probably an editorial team but again you just have to have a firm understanding of what kind of content is on the site you're writing and if this matches the value you can provide so spend some time actually reading a website look on Google or search you know some of the most popular posts and get an idea of where you could fit into that space but website doesn't seem like a good fit honestly you can still write a letter of introduction but make sure you don't oversell yourself or promise that you can write articles you're not actually qualified or capable of writing so let's say your portfolio is nice you picked some clients you actually have a few contracts now your.</p>

            <p>
              <span class="text-warning"> The third Step : </span> Here is just not to neglect networking blogging has been great for me and this is again why I encourage you to start a blog outside of the fact that you can <span class="text-warning"> make money with your blog </span> it lets you meet so many people in that niche that you pick that just in turn will open so many doors you're not gonna find on websites like up work or just scouring remote job boards I'm also attending fincon later this year which is a financial event that's honestly another great way to get your foot in the door to meet a considerable number of people in a very short amount of time.

            don't be scared to buy a ticket to one of these events that actually pertains to your niche the idea of spending a few hundred dollars on a ticket and accommodations might suck at first but if you approach it the right way and
            you're ready to take that next step it's honestly worth the money or at least worth the risk if you ask me now you have more clients and you know some steady contract next step and this is where I'm slowly trying to get towards is just honing your skill and becoming a better freelance writer overall the first and most obvious way to do this is to just keep an eye and be mindful of the edits that are being made to your work the way a lot of freelance writing arrangements work is you write an article up to a certain point you'll hand it off to an editor.</p>
            <p>they'll do some tweaks maybe they pass it off to an SEO guy and then it gets published at some point it's a good habit to look back and to see what edits have been made to the content you submitted it to see why those might have been made personally I love run-on sentences I know it's my worst flaw as a freelance writer and that is what usually gets edited out content now making a bit of a mindful effort to cut back on lengthy sentences and to trim the fat of my articles another step you can take is just to continually improve your education to look for different courses or groups you can join that help make people better writers one I really recommend looking at is a course called hit publish it's by Ashley Barnett and Ashley is an amazing, amazing editor I've been lucky to work with her she's the editor for some pretty impressive personal finance publications and she's just a stellar editor and writer her course hit published kind of helps you become a better writer and learn how to write really captivating content if you're at a stage where you feel like your hard skills as a writer are really holding you back and you'd love to learn from somebody who's been in the business.

            <h2>4) make editors happy :</h2>
            <p> <span class="text-warning">The fourth Step :</span>  Is to really make editors happy and to make sure you can keep these contracts for a long time one of the things I had to realize very quickly and very early on was that your job is to <span class="text-warning"> make an editor happy </span>if the producer is all sharing to write great quality work but if you make a editors life hell they're not gonna keep you around or they're not going to want to actually work with you so the real question is <span class="text-warning"> what are some things you can do with your writing </span> that pretty much makes everybody's life easier and makes people want to keep you on as a freelance writer the first and most obvious way to do this is you have to always meet your deadlines.            
          </p>
          <p>If you get an article assigned to you and you have a problem with the deadline or you think it'll be tight and there's any risk at all that you won't be able to meet it make sure you tell them ahead of time some publications have a very strict and rigid publishing schedule or they're trying to get certain content published immediately because maybe it's pressing you miss a deadline with no explanation you're pretty much cooked secondly should always ask for clarification if you don't understand something don't make assumptions that's also something I struggled with in the beginning I would assume the editor meant X when in reality two men why just results in a lot of the emails back and forth you have to make a revision to the article which takes up more of your time you're not necessarily getting paid for that third always admit mistakes if you over bill or you accidentally mess up on an article or you forget some piece of information that's important own up to your mistake find a way to actually fix it make a mistake don't blame anybody own up to it and make sure you keep editors copy and the only other tip I can give here is to really up your attention to detail you're ready for somebody else or a massive you need to match your quality no matter how high it is or if you think they're even going a bit overboard you're a contractor and you have to make people who are contracting you happy to step up your attention to detail reduce good content and make sure you always are friendly and enjoyable to work with.
         </p>
         <p>let's say now you've had a few clients editors generally like you and <span class="text-warning">
          you're making study money as a freelance writer you just want to scale your income </span>  this is where this next step really comes in handy next step relates to increasing your workload and there's two main ways to do this the first is of course to keep pitching clients which I try to get into habit of doing every few weeks or whenever I see an opportunity out there and this is good because it helps diversify your pool of clients in case of some drop you have a second option as well and that's just to email existing clients stating that you have more availability for the month or next few months coming up people kind of forget this one but you'd be amazed if you just send a simple email saying hey remember me I'm your freelance writer guy I have a lot of time this month we're off in the note you'll finally have plenty of content on the back burner just focusing on so many other things and projects at once that maybe they haven't prioritize certain things if you give them a reminder and a little nudge oftentimes will say oh great you know I can send you two more articles this month boo there you go you just got more work on your plate as a freelance writer.

            <h2>5) freelance writing contracts are based per word not per article :</h2>
            <p> <span class="text-warning">This is how you kind of accelerate your career and your income level as a freelance writer </span> is to raise your rates over time but a lot of freelance writing contracts are based per word not per article and that might surprise a lot of beginner freelance writers this means that a difference of a few cents per word actually makes a pretty substantial difference in how much you actually get paid for article there's kind of two main ways you can raise this per word amount you're getting paid first is to reach out to old clients maybe after about a year and say hey look I've been writing for you for a year know the kind of quality I produce and I'm worth it for your team I need to raise my rates by this amount pitch it to them you work out an agreement and maybe it works maybe it does I've had this backfire where I told the client hey I'm writing for this many clients in my own blog I you know the only way we can really continue to work is we have to raise the rate to this.         
          </p>
          <p>They weren't able to do it I ended up walking away you have to be able to do that and to have the confidence to know what you're writing is worth what your hourly rate is worth and what you're simply not going to write for the second way to increase your rate steadily as a freelance writer is just to increase it for the new clients and maybe the bigger publications you're getting if you started out
              <span class="text-warning"> let's say a ten cents per word or seven cents per word maybe the next time you sign a client you have more portfolio pieces </span>and more to show and more experience you say hey I'm writing for fifteen cents a week now or twelve cents will do that for another six months and then you move up to the 20 cents 25 cents word mark you still have to have realistic expectations here you can't just charge an amount that's insanely above your niche so this is again why networking with different writers in the space really helps because you can kind of pick each other's brains or learn a bit of the insider you know news that's going on about oh hey these guys pay this mantra these guys pay really well these guys say they pay well but then in reality it's such a headache it's not worth your time network increase your rates over time and<span class="text-warning"> be confident that after a while of providing value for a client </span> you can enter negotiations about increasing your once reading rate.

            <h2>6)do freelance writing and that's it and they absolutely crush it :</h2>
            <p>we're really accelerating your<span class="text-warning">freelance writing career </span>and this is something I'm trying to experiment with it so just look for more opportunities in the space that you're building yourself in a lot of people do freelance writing and that's it and they absolutely crush it and that's totally fine but if you come across opportunities you can use to significantly boost your income and gain new experience you might as well take them right for me there's been some upward consulting I've done a bit of SEO stuff in the past and I'm obviously working on my blog other people end up getting it too editing or they sell courses or they know coaching services to help people become a better freelance writer themselves editing is probably the most linear progression you can make but again there's so many different options here it's really just about keeping an open mind continually becoming better at what you do networking a ton and then looking for different opportunities to expand your presence in a niche.                        
          </p>
          <p>
            This is probably one of the steps you would take later on your  freelance writing career and it's something I'm just exploring now so I definitely don't have all the answers but as long as you work hard to make a good impression on people you come
            across you'll generally find that more doors open up than you previously expect that about does it for the different steps you can use to become a freelance writer without any experience it's honestly a career path that takes different people different amount of time and some people really make a killing with it and some people struggle to get past that content mill writing stage of freelance right now honestly think it's an awesome job I like the flexibility I like being able to work from a laptop wherever I so choose to in the world my overall tip here is to take a realistic view of where you are in your freelance writing career where other people you know are and make a plan to actually get there and follow it you go back to this strategy of just begging people through email for guest post opportunities I don't think you're gonna get somewhere or it might take you a very long time to see results take action and pick a niche build your portfolio and start pitching clients in that simple letter of introduction format that Clint outlined in his awesome post go read that post I meant to continually improve your skills network and over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                you'll find that more opportunity falls into your lap whether you're looking forward at that moment or not if you're currently in a rut with your freelance writing career or <span class="text-warning"> you're a complete beginner freelance writer I really hope that this article has
