Now all of these companies that sell online whether they sell on Amazon they saw on Shopify they've got their own course their own digital product no matter what it is the number one challenge that every company online has is selling their products they want to get more sales right they want to increase the number of buyers and customers that they have and so that's why all of these companies out there including Amazon they have affiliate programs an affiliate program.

                <h2>3 WAYS TO EARN MONEY FROM AMAZON :</h2>
                <p>Although Jeff Bezos did start off the company selling books, Amazon new sells almost anything you can think of. It’s not just a site for buying your favorite toys though; <b> you can actually make money with Amazon.</b></p>
                <p>And here are three ways you can earn money online,
                   </p>
                <p> <span class="text-warning">The first way is Amazon Mturk – </span>Mechanical truk is the kind of like up works, it’s a place where businesses outsource work that is too difficult for a computer program to do. Such as audio editing and transcribing, translating audio and video from different languages, testing webpage’s, writing reviews, and a whole lot of other services.</p>
                <p>You can make as much as $20,$30 an hour, by working on a few different tasks. This is a legit way of making money, and they do pay. This is an active income though.</p>
                <p><span class="text-warning">The Second Way is Amazon Kindle – </span> publishing, Turn your ideas into an eBook and make money today. Every time you buy an ebook from Amazon, Amazon and the publisher make money, and you can too. The thing with Kindle publishing is you first need a book to sell.</p>
                <p>You can either write this book yourself or you can hire someone to write it for you. You don’t have to be an established author, or find a publishing company to do this. You can actually do this from the comfort of your home and start earning some passive income. Sounds awesome right? And the best part is, it’s absolutely free, so sign up and start making some money. Amazon takes care of the money handling shenanigans and you can sit back relax on your couch while making some good old passive income. If you are really interested in Kindle publishing, I highly recommend you do more research on this topic. You can find free videos and tutorials right here on youtube that will teach you the basics.</p>
                <p>If you want expert advice, you might have to first pay for a course. Some people make over $100,000 publishing Kindle e-books on Amazon. It’s definitely a market to look into.</p>
                <p><span class="text-warning">The Third Way Amazon associates program - </span> This is a very popular and easy way of earning passive income. All you do is sign up to the Amazon associates program which is free then you can pick from thousands of stuff Amazon sells on their website and start promoting. Amazon will give you a special link, and every time someone buys through your link, Amazon will give you a commission anywhere from 5 – 10% of the sale.</p>
                <p>Amazon will pay you 60 days after purchase and you can choose  to be paid either through Amazon gift cards, wire transfer to a bank account – although this is currently only available in the US if you live outside America you can be paid via cheques, or you can have  the money transferred to your Amazon account and start buying stuff with it.</p>

                        <h2>AMAZON AFFILIATE MARKETING: MAKE MONEY ONLINE :</h2>
                        <p>Number two would be affiliate marketing <b class="text-warning">  is my favorite way of making money online</b>    
                       and affiliate marketing is always going to be relevant and always have opportunity and potential because affiliate marketing is when you promote other people's products. Now all of these companies that sell online whether they sell on Amazon they saw on Shopify they've got their own course their own digital product no matter what it is the number one challenge that every company online has is selling their products they want to get more sales right they want to increase the number of buyers and customers that they have and so that's why all of these companies out there including Amazon they have affiliate programs an affiliate program.
                           </p>
                           <p> That anybody can join they're free to join so for example if you want to join amazon's affiliate program you can if you want to join an affiliate program for most products out there you can and when you join their affiliate program. They're gonna give you a percentage out of every sale you generate for them so <b class="text-warning"> they give you an affiliate link you can use that link under blog on your YouTube channel, your social media you know you're running ads or whatever it is you can use that link and when you generate.</b>
                            </p>
                        <p> <b class="text-warning"> when you drive traffic and people click on the link and they buy the product you earn you earn a commission</b> from that you know it's pretty awesome because you didn't have to create the product you didn't have to invent it you don't have to take the risk you didn't have to invest in inventory you didn't have to build a team and have customer service and all the expenses that are involved in creating and selling a product as an affiliate marketer you can just promote someone else's product by sending your affiliate link or whatever it is and you make Commission's from it so affiliate marketing is one of the best ways it's one of the easiest ways to make money online and get started because you don't have to invest as much time or money or take as big of a risk as selling your own product okay so I love affiliate marketing gives the opportunity to promote any product on Amazon that you want as an affiliate earn a commission from it and there's  lot of products you can sell that are higher ticket specifically online courses where you can earn a higher commission from you can earn a more higher commission from that and it's great.
                        </p>
                        <p>so affiliate marketing is always relevant because every company is always gonna welcome affiliates. I always want people to help them sell and promote their products and they're more than happy to give you a commission from that. so affiliate marketing is great it's one of the best opportunities and often what I look at to this might be a bit more advanced I look at how you can combine them together because listen if you've got a product you're selling on Amazon your own Shopify store whatever you're collecting the buyers and customers and ultimately your goal of that is not just to have a one time buyer a one time consumer but someone that is gonna buy from you again and again so you always want to build an email list of your buyers and customers whether that's selling on Amazon or Shopify but there's always a back-end component to every business because it's a lot easier for you to profit from customers you already have then going out there and acquiring new customers as the customers you already have they've already bought from you they've already raised their hand they're looking for help they already trust you because I've already purchased from you once and you've delivered for them a great product it's a lot easier to for you them to profit from them by focusing more on how to serve your existing customers and one of the best ways to do that is through affiliate marketing because if you have an email list then you can promote products to them and share them sure more additional products that can help serve them that you could be an affiliate for that you didn't have to invent or create yourself and <b class="text-warning"> you can earn commissions from that.</b>
                           </p>
                           <div class="amazon-img-center text-center mb-3">
                           <img src="../img/workfromhome/amazon-2.jpg" alt="money amazon" class="img-fluid" title="affiliate marketting">
                        </div>
                        <p>So I always look at how you can combine them together right how you can leverage affiliate marketing with physical products combine the two together to increase her back end and ultimately the long-term value of your customers the third one that I'd say is being an influencer now we all know the power of influence and the trend of what influencers has been over the last few years and it's not slowing down I mean these days everyone is becoming an influencer and influencers is such a great opportunity because all of these platforms out there such as YouTube and Instagram and a podcast and a blog and Facebook all of these platforms they're free to use anybody can join and set up a YouTube account a Facebook account and create content you can share your ideas with the world.
                           </p>   
                       <p>you can share what you're learning you can entertain people you can express yourself in whatever way that you want and if your content is good and valuable then people will find it they'll follow you and they'll build a relationship with you the most valuable thing you could ever have on the Internet is attention  because attention is what all these companies are trying to get that's why they spend money on advertisements. so that they can get in front of you they can get your attention because without your attention then you're not gonna go in and buy their product but influencers are people that have built a following they built an audience of people they have people's attention and more importantly they built a relationship and trust with those people over a period of time.
                           </p>    
                           <p>Now companies out there they're looking to market their products and so they're looking for influencers to represent their product to share their product with their audience to be an ambassador of their product they're looking if you have a podcast they want to sponsor your podcast to get the attention of some of your listeners on your podcast or on the YouTube channel right that's why on YouTube videos you might see advertisements pop up because companies they want to get in front of my audience and other people's audiences on YouTube so they're willing to pay money for that and if you're an influencer you have a following people will pay money to you to get in front of your audience they'll give you products and say hey listen to you can you share your product with your audience I'll pay you to sponsor this post and share it with your audience having a following gives the opportunity to launch your own course your own Amazon product or do affiliate marketing there's a lot of different avenues that you can do as an influencer.
                               </p>
                               <p>So influencer marketing is hot it's growing and it's not saturated because here's what I've learned about being an influencer I've got over a million followers now with my YouTube and Instagram and podcast and my blog all of that so I have a quite a bit of reach and influence which is great but the thing with being an influencer is that everybody will connect and relate to someone different okay there's only one of you and there's only one of me so nobody could ever copy anyone okay it's impossible to because we are each unique and different always and everyone is looking for someone that they can relate to that they can connect with and follow that is like them people like people that are like them so.
                                   </p>
                      <p>For example, if you're in let's say the self-development niche which is massive right I'm part of the self-development market now people don't necessarily follow you for your content that's one component of it but more importantly they're following you for who you are your story and because they connect with you so a lot of these influencers let's say coaches YouTubers podcasters bloggers in the self-development arena we can share the same content whether it's about goal-setting and creating great habits in your life and be more positive and be more happy and being motivated changing your belief systems improving your health your relationships all of that but the content the message, for the most part, is the same but what makes it unique and different is your story and how you explain things your you know for example, for me my story about how these things have helped my life and my delivery of the content and the information.
                       </p>     
                       <div class="amazon-img-center text-center mb-3">
                            <img src="../img/workfromhome/amazon-3.jpg" alt="affiliate marketting amazon" class="img-fluid" title="make money from amazon">
                         </div>
                       <p>Because people are gonna relate to my story over someone else's story not everyone will relate to me some of you will others won't others will relate to someone else people will relate and connect to you based on your age if you're young then a younger demographic are gonna connect with you if you're older let's say you're you know in your 40s and 50s and 60s then maybe you know that ones that are in their 20s aren't going to connect with you as much they can't relate to someone maybe that's in their 50s but someone that's in their 40s and 50s and 60s they're gonna connect and relate more and want to follow the person that is similar to them and their demographic versus the person that's 20 years old if you're a male or a female I mean if you're a male you're more likely to follow someone that's also a male because you can connect and relate to them more.
                           </p>        
                           <p>If you're a female you're more likely to follow someone that's a female even based on race if you're white if you're black if you're Asian if you're Hispanic not that you can't and of course everybody you know you'll still all different races and diversity is gonna follow everybody but your core demographic are gonna be more people if you're white people that are white if you're Asian people that are Asian because again people like people that are like them they're gonna follow it connect with that a little bit more you friends that you have in your life I'm sure most of your friends that are people they're more similar to you, you have similar beliefs and values and goals and you might even look similar you might be in a similar age group if you're a male most of your friends are probably males if you're a female most of your friends are probably females so your story and who you are makes you unique and different than everyone else out there and the world needs more people that are different and unique to share and help and serve and it's not like you know one person only follows one person people follow many people today so there's so much room and opportunity there is an influencer and it's just something that companies are looking more for and the amount of money you can make as an influencer is only going to go up over a period of time so influencer marketing as I think is great and when I look at the platforms available I say the ones that have the greatest opportunity potential I consider is number one YouTube okay because the video is King.
                               </p>
                               <p>Video is the most consumed type of content on the Internet it's not slowing down more and more people their attention span is shorter. So they are  more engaged by video and when you watch a video you can connect with that person a lot more than you can by reading their article or even listening to them on a podcast or just getting short snippets from them on Instagram for  example it's more designed like one-minute video clips it's more surface level and shallow content YouTube or podcasts or even blogs they're more deeper content so for you watching this video for the last 12 minutes or so it's we're going a lot deeper you're getting to know me a lot more and a lot deeper than you would on Instagram or Facebook for example so and your and most likely you're fully engaged with me in this video you know you're looking at me right now you're listening to me right now versus a podcast you might be driving your car you might be at the gym it's more of a secondary modality you're listening as you're doing other things so the video I think is the most powerful. 
                                   </p>
