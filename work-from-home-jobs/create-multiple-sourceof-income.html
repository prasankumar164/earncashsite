             <h1>HOW TO CREATE MULTIPLE SOURCE OF INCOME FOR YOUR FUTURE</h1>
             <p>Today's Article we are going to be talking about how we can develop multiple streams of income and I'm pretty sure no matter what your age is even if you're a teenager you will find something helpful in today's Article. 
            </p>

            <P>If you know about more ways in which you can improve your income streams it's very important to have multiple streams of income because when you depend on only one job or only one source if for some reason things don't go right you may be in a big problem which is why it's very important to increase the number of sources by which you are making money as much as I would like to say that money is not important it is so make sure that you are never in a bad situation financially and developing multiple streams of income will help you attain that financial stability.</P>

             <span class="end"></span>

     </div>
   








     <div class="index-two">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="index-two-img text-center">
                    <img src="../img/workfromhome/Focus-on-one-thing-and-then-diversify.jpg" alt="Focus on one thing and then diversify" title="Focus on one thing and then diversify" class="img-fluid">
           </div>
            <h2 class="text-uppercase">1) Focus on one thing and then diversify:</h2>
            <P>Now the first rule in this scenario is always to focus on one thing and then diversify so let me tell you guys about my multiple streams of income so my number one stream of income is obviously YouTube my second stream of income is Instagram my third stream of income is affiliate marketing for the sponsorships which is not stable but it's still there I am also a social media manager so I do social media marketing for clients and  get paid for that so that's again a different source of income and these are the active ways by which I'm making money apart from that I've also invested in mutual funds and fixed deposits by which I am gonna be making passive money hopefully. </P>

            <P>I have about five or six streams of income right now and obviously I'm always working to expand it and if I see that a certain stream of income is not you know yielding as much I'll cut it off soon but currently these are the streams of incomes that I have there was a certain amount of time when I was like doing 13 things that's not as advisable because it takes a lot more time and I am making much more now that I was doing back then because my attention was divided so when you are trying to build multiple streams of income don't go into all of them at the same time focus on one thing first start working in that field and once you have established yourself in it go to the second.
            </P>

            <P>So some of my suggestions for making money in other streams than your regular job will be content writing if you can write well ice over if you have a good voice youtubing if you have time and are friendly with the camera also you don't really need a camera for youtubing you can do it on your phone you normal phone and your buland hours that's all you need to make youtube videos you can start a youtube channel very easily you can do so many things I am pretty sure a Google search will help you understand but these are the few things that I have done I've also done tutoring in the past and these are some ways by which you can create a second income source now let's talk about how you can start developing these income streams step-by-step.</P>

     <div class="index-two">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="index-two-img text-center">
                    <img src="../img/workfromhome/time.jpg" alt="calculate your extra time" title="calculate your extra time" class="img-fluid">
           </div>
            <h2 class="text-uppercase">2) calculate your extra time:</h2>
            <P>The first thing that you need to do when you start building multiple sources of income is to take out how much time you have left every day, because I have a lot of privileges because of which I am being able to invest so much energy into so many things in my college life not everybody has those privileges so you have to check what is the time left after you do your regular course are there some things that you can delegate to other people other things that you're doing which don't really need your time are you doing useless things are you spending too much time on social media I'm pretty sure there are so many ways by which you can take out some time every day even if you can just take out one art just an hour every day that's like 30 art per month and I'm pretty sure you can do something really great with that amount of time left but in case you can't take out any time I think the best way for you to make a second income or the third income will obviously be to invest in mutual funds of FDS because those are passive income streams for active income streams you do need some time so take a piece of paper and write down how much time you have on an average body the birds are really tough,  so once you have taken aside that time decide which skill or which product you are going to create.</P>

            <P>If you want to sell something you need to create the product right and you know guys I've seen so many people who have a property a job but they
                decided to open a craft store where they you know make jewelry and certain stuff like that and they are making over fifty, sixty thousand a month and their craft store at the side so if you want to sell a product even then it's a really really good way to make a second income now
                once you've decided which skill you want to improve on which product you want to sell you need to do the rest of the steps which are the worst which is how you should be doing this now I can't tell you individually for every niche what to do but just do a google search and check out people who are already doing what you do read as much as you can hear as many podcasts as you can on the topic that you are building
                your skill on or building your product on and I'm pretty sure you'll be good to go. 
                
            </P>

            <P>You can also get in touch with the people who are doing these just because they can clear out your doubts faster than anyone else and they will help you the most so yeah that's the next step that you need to take after you decide which skill you want to improve on these are all free ways but there are plenty of paid courses too the best thing about paid courses is that once you take a paid course you know that there's some sort of credibility in the course creator which will help you get on track so I told you guys that I'm a social media manager so this started in February when I took a course and I'll recommend you that really it was the best course that I've ever taken and it was also the first
                course that I'd ever taken I'm taking a few more now but the thing is this course actually helped me understand how to get clients online for social media marketing good clients to be specific.</P>

            <P>Because I did have clients before that but they were not high paying clients and the good thing about high paying clients is that only one client is enough for a decent amount of site income for a month and that is why I took this course and I invested about twenty five thousand in this course and I already made like three times my money back.</P>

                    <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/11-COURSE-SALES.jpg" alt="start selling" title="start selling" class="img-fluid">
           </div>
            <h2 class="text-uppercase">3) start selling:</h2>
            <P>Obviously there's a lot of free content available as well so if you don't have a budget no worries about it once you've developed your skill and products you need to sell and selling me sound a bit difficult but with Instagram and Facebook it's become easier than ever you can list your products on Amazon, Instagram instant more and all these places where people come and buy things you if you are selling services be active in Facebook groups which will look for your services and that is how you basically get started with your first client I know it is very difficult I just crunched all the information into a small Article so when you go out there and start implementing these it's gonna be difficult but it's not impossible I have done it thousands of people have done it and once you start doing these things the difficult thing is obviously to get started for the first time but once you've gotten started you'd see that it's not as difficult anymore.</P>

            <P>You'll be getting clients very soon and your second or third source of income will be expanding very well once you've set up this stream you can move on to your next venture I hope these tips helped you I follow a lot of good pages on Instagram about business and they do suggest some great content about things that you can do and I'll attach some pictures from those pages itself because it may give you some ideas about what
                your next stream of income should be but guys make sure that whatever you are doing you are not exhausting yourself it's very very easy to get overwhelmed and feel like I want to do everything please  don't do that just set up something fast and then start working on the next having said that I am also working on two new ventures number one is an e-book of mine which is a book on freelancing I have read written about 2,000 words so far and I'm pretty excited for it.
            </P>

            <P>I am being a bit lazy because I should have probably finished writing 15,000 words by today but I am going real slow but once it comes out I am pretty sure it will help you guys in case you want to make a living by freelancing also I am working on setting up a store a stationery store with my mother and  I'm pretty excited for these two ventures and worried the second one because I've never dealt in products never ever I have always been service based and information based but I think I really wanted to do this also like I wanted my mother to do something she really  wants to do something because she's been a housewife all her life and I really wanted to give her an opportunity to do something so this these are the two things that are coming up from my aim.</P>

            <P>Let me know what are you doing today by the way do keep in mind that I've been working since I was a teenager which means that I have had a lot of privilege I have had so many connections in the past three or four years that it has helped me do the new ventures that I'm starting now but in case you don't don't worry just talk to people and I'm pretty sure you'll develop connections and connections are going to help you a lot in doing whatever you want to do whatever industry or whatever skill you want to specialize in you need to have friends who do the same thing so make sure you're connecting with new people learning new things every day and keep improving I recommend a few books for reading.</P>

            <P>In case you want to develop good and multiple streams of income 
                number one will be Think and Grow Rich the next will be the six-figure 
                second income and you want secrets of self-made millionaires by Brian Tracy and zero to one by Peter Thiel 
                which is basically a book about startups so make sure you're checking out these books all these books are available on story-tell.
            </P>

            <P>Because I'm pretty sure that if you want to improve your life your financial stability you need to read books books are the only reason that I have done whatever I have done because books make me aware of a lot more things in the world than anything else would have,  I hope you guys find this article helpful to you.</P>
