             </div>
             <p>how to earn money from blogging, Now obviously as a blogger, the first thing I can talk about is blogging whether you like being on camera making videos or traveling taking selfies you can do so many things guys you can start your own website you can have a YouTube channel, tik-tok page you can have Instagram profiles there are so many options guys the limit.
            </p>
            <P>The only problem with blogging which is there are a couple of problems it takes time to enter the space enter this industry it takes a lot of time a lot of effort and of course there will be haters you know like I know by the end of this article I would have shared so many important information so many important things but there still be something haters will be talking about something and how I'm looking and things like that and saying mean things and at times it can get to you because ultimately we all are humans so haters are definitely there.
           </P>
           <p>Number two very importantly it's not exactly a part-time job like you can start part-time but if you really want to earn money you have to get really into it so you can either hire a team get a bunch of people to work for you but it is a lot of effort so it's not something which you can do on the side for a very long time because after a while you have to explore other options and other things but it's  <b class="text-warning">definitely something that you can explore if you do like you know doing the creative stuff.</b></p>

                <div class="ecom-two-content">
                    <h2>Blogging:  MAKE MONEY ONLINE :</h2>
                    <p>The Third one is blogging and podcasts I kind of put even and it really depends on what your preference is podcasting I like because people can go deep and they a lot of people listen to podcasts the thing I don't like about podcasts is that it's very untrackable it's hard to track things on a podcast and most often like for example you know iTunes doesn't really give you much data of your viewership and your followers and all that sort of stuff excuse me but on the other hand a blog is very different than that a blog you can track everything on the blog and you can update and change there's just a lot you can do with it now each of them there's a learning curve to each of course and there's different skills involved with it but I like blogging especially if you <b class="text-warning"> learn search engine optimization and how to rank your content </b> but again like I said it depends on what you prefer if you're more of a writer if you prefer speaking you know there's different platforms that might be better suited based on your gifts and your skills of what you want to go deeper with in terms of social media I think Instagram is the best and will continue to be in 2020
                       </p>
                       <p>Instagram you know more powerful than Snapchat and even Facebook now a lot of internet entrepreneurs are investing in their Instagram building they are following their you can build a deep relationship with people on Instagram as well especially with stories by sharing your life the day to day cuz people on Instagram they are getting more of the behind-the-scenes they are getting to know more about you when you're not you know doing a YouTube video or a podcast they are gonna see what you're doing throughout the day and when you have daily influence over someone like that every day you make a post on Instagram or a story and you're a part of someone's life on a daily basis  that's powerful you have influence over their beliefs in the direction of their life.
                        </p>
                        <p>So influencer marketing guys is huge and will continue to be huge in 2020 and beyond the last one I want to share with you is not necessarily starting an online business because I know some of you that are watching this right now you might not want to put yourself out there you know and that's why I provide options I mean Amazon is greater you don't have to put yourself out there you can actually as an Amazon selling a physical product you can find influencers and partner with them and send them products and they can be the influencers for your business or
                       physical product brands so not even wants to put themselves out there you might want to be more behind the scenes.</p>
                       <p> <b class="text-warning"> everyone, not an entrepreneur not everyone wants to run their own show not everybody wants to take the risks of what an entrepreneur</b> does you know obviously entrepreneurship provides a lot more and potential but not everyone cares for that I think a great opportunity online is just being a freelancer.
