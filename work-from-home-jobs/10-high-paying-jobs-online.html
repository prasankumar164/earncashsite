            <h2>1) marketer agency: work from home :</h2>
            <p>The number one work-from-home option that you can take advantage of in 2019 early 2020 we will get to in one second  without further ado the number one option is what's called a  marketer agency is you actually run digital marketing and social media ads on behalf of other businesses think about real estate agents dentists doctors insurance agents these local businesses that are falling behind and don't know how to do basic social media ads that take five minutes to set up and you would be very surprised at how much real estate agents are willing to pay for somebody to set up basic Facebook ads for them and basic Google Ads.
            </p>
            <p>Because they're busy selling houses they're busy buying houses they don't have time to learn how to do online advertising but online advertising is the single most profitable thing that they can do for their business it differentiates them from their competitors and it really allows them to actually increase their bottom line and increase their profit without having to work longer hours or hire more employees and so if you learn how to set up even a very basic Facebook and Google ads that I could literally teach you in five minutes how to set up businesses are willing to pay $1,000 $2,000 $3,000 or more per month for you to actually run these ads on their behalf and when you add one or two or even three clients it's very easy to get to ten thousand dollars per month within just a couple of months of doing this and the best part about creating a marketer agency is you can get paid $1,000 $2,000 or more as soon as this week.
            </p>
            <p>

            <h2>2) online flipper: work from home :</h2>
            <p>Right this is also called an online garage seller and basically how you take advantage of this is you find things that people give away for free or extremely cheap and you flip those things either on those same platforms or online let me give you an example there are apps like let go and offer up and the Facebook marketplace and Craigslist where people are moving every single day.
            </p>
            <p>They're just trying to get rid of their stuff they're trying to get rid of washers and dryers they're trying to get rid of their sofas they're trying to get rid of all sorts of things so that they can just move and they're over and they're done with it but if you have time and you want to work from home you can go pick up things like washers and dryers and sporting equipment and all types of things that have a lot of value and you can go ahead and sell those same things on Amazon you can sell those things on eBay you can realistic marketplace let go offer up Craigslist for a significant profit and it's very easy to get started doing this especially.
            </p>
            <p>If you have access to a car or a truck you can really take advantage of this and you can start earning thousands of dollars per week if you're going at this full time of course this particular option you do sometimes have to leave your home unless people are actually dropping the stuff off at your house but it's one of the coolest ways that you can get started with zero money to start and you can get started as soon as today and start making money doing this and while there isn't an actual average of how much online garage sellers earn have many friends that are actually doing this and they're earning well over $20 an hour just finding free stuff on apps like let go offer up Craigslist and Facebook marketplace and then taking better pictures re-listing it on eBay Amazon or even back on the same apps where they found it and selling it for a hefty profit.

            <h2>3) call center represented : </h2>
            <p>The cool thing about a call center representative is all you need to be able to do this is your phone you don't even need a laptop and you can do this entirely from home all you need is your voice right and so if you like talking like me and you can talk and talk and talk in front of a camera all day long and maybe a call center representative.
            </p>
            <p>Might be the option of you and while call center representatives might not earn as much as some of the other work from home options we've discussed it's a really great way that you could actually get started especially if all you have access to is your cell phone and according to indeed com the average hourly earnings of a call center representative are about fifteen dollars.

            <p>Before a game you roll your eyes and say prasan I can't edit videos there are literally infinite tutorials when it comes to using three tools like iMovie and things like DaVinci where you can create and edit videos with literally no skills just by watching an hour-long tutorial and this is very important guys you can't expect to not be willing to learn anything new if you want to work from home if you want things you've never had you have to try things you've never done and being willing to learn and learning.
            </p>
            <p>How to learn utilizing resources on YouTube or things like Google tutorials or blog because there are infinite resources at your fingertips because of Google and because of the internet and it's up to you to actually take advantage of those things if you want it bad enough to work from home and the average amount that you can make to actually sit at home and edit videos on your computer is about 17 dollars per hour according to indeed.com

            <h2>5)website designer : </h2>
            <p>Before you say prasan I can't make a website websites nowadays are actually extremely easy to make with sites like Wix and WordPress and click funnels you can get a fully functioning website with no technical skill just from a tutorial on YouTube  one from nothing too completely finished in less than an hour.
            </p>
            <p>So, if you're willing to actually learn how to create a website there are pretty much infinite opportunities when it comes to building out websites for businesses and getting paid very handsomely to do so and obviously based on your skillset experience and expertise when it comes to web design and how much skill you can actually push forth towards the development of a website the salary can range immensely but what I found when I actually did some research on this is the average starting wage of a website designer and creator is about $25 per hour.

            <h2>6) freelance writer : </h2>
            <p>Before you say to yourself but prasan I'm not the best writer you don't have to be the best writer if you can write at all you can get paid based on your level of writing comprehension and how good you are overall at writing and there's a lot of different websites to do this but one of the best websites is called text broker people need content for their Instagram people need content for their Facebook pages for their social media.
            </p>
            <p>people just need content that other people can consume and the better and better that you actually get at freelance writing and creating content that people like to read and creating content that actually gets read the more you can actually get paid to do this and according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics authors as a general category do makeover 60,000 dollars a year but freelance writers make more like $40,000 a year so when you break that down to an hourly wage that works out to be around $19 per hour but of course as you get better and find better clients can make more than that freelance.

            <h2>7) tutor : </h2>
            <p>There are so many different services online where you can get paid to tutor people nowadays in what you're actually good at maybe it's chemistry maybe it's biology maybe it's mathematics maybe you can teach English but the fact of the matter is you are an expert at something even if you don't think you are and someone out there in the world wants to pay you for that expertise even if you just speak English you can literally get paid to tutor someone in English if you speak multiple languages you can get paid to tutor them in multiple languages or mathematics or any type of educational skill if you want to get paid to tutor There are a ton of websites out there for you to check out but a couple that I recommend are tutors.com and tutorme.com 
            </p>
            <p>Where you can actually sign up with what you're good at or what you know how to do and you can get matched up with people who want to pay you to do it and while the range for a tutor can vary ridiculously one of the averages that I kept saying at gaming again was about 17 dollars an hour on average as a tutor but obviously if you have a specialized skill or if you get specific clients you can earn significantly more than that as you start to get better and better at becoming an online tutor.

            <p>What that means is you take what somebody is actually saying in a video and you actually type it down so that you can create subtitles for that video I probably get 10 or 20 people a day offering me translation services for my YouTube channel to expand into countries like Saudi Arabia and Japan and Korea and Latin America and all over the world what a transcriptionist allows you to do is actually create subtitles for videos and get paid to do that a funny story is we hired somebody on up work to do transcriptions for us and he actually did is such a good job.

            </p>
            <p>That we ended up hiring him full-time and now he's one of the most important members of my team and so all of these work from home positions if you get the right person you can get hired on with a full-time salary and benefits and bonuses like I give all of my team members but the cool thing is guys all you have to be able to do to be a transcriptionist is be able to type and listen to a video and actually create subtitles for and while salaries obviously vary based on your experience and where you're working from around the world and what language you're transcribing things in I found a general range was about $15 an hour to be a transcriptionist number.

            <p>You've probably heard of Apple and Amazon but what you might not know is the Apple and Amazon and many other large companies hire people just like you every single day to actually perform customer surveys via chat on behalf of their businesses Apple actually has a program where you can sign up to be an Apple chat support customer service member of their team and you can get paid pretty well to actually do that and while the salary might range between these different companies I found that the average Apple chat support member is earning between twelve and eighteen dollars to actually answer customer service requests on behalf of Apple.

            <h2>10) social media manager :</h2>
            <p>While most of you have probably heard of social media maybe you haven't heard of how much you can actually make as a social media manager. especially as you start to get better and better and find more and more clients to do this and you can even scale this by hiring virtual assistants and people from you know the Philippines and from Bangalore and from places with a cheaper cost of living to actually help you run a social media management agency.
            </p>
            <P>We're just gonna talk about doing it for yourself because that can be very lucrative too so as a social media manager basically what you're going to be doing is you're going to be posting content for entrepreneurs like myself for companies right for small businesses for Amazon businesses ecommerce businesses you can get hired by any number of business because everyone out there nowadays knows that the real money is to be made by posting on social media that's where the people are right people used to be on radio then it was TV now people are on social media and YouTube and so if you can get good at creating content like viral images and memes and short form video content just like Gary Vaynerchuk and myself do every single day then any company or entrepreneur would be happy to hire you to help them actually create content and post it on Instagram and Pinterest and LinkedIn and Facebook and YouTube and all of these different social media platforms.
            </P>
            <P>That become very difficult to actually run and create content for yourself as an entrepreneur or a business owner and so you take over that role posting content on behalf of entrepreneurs or businesses and they can pay you very handsomely to actually do that and after doing some research of what freelancers are actually charging to do this I came up with an average of three to four thousand dollars every single month to do social media management services on behalf of businesses.
