        <p>I'm just going to be talking about the 5 ways that my blog actually makes
          money and also the three things that I don't do I've been blogging for about
          eight years at this point but for the first five years or so I did not make a
          dime for my blog it's only been in about the last three years that my blog
          actually started getting traffic and started making money but at this point of
          working at actually monetizing it for about three years my blog does produce
          enough income to support my family full-time.</p>
      </div>


     



          


      <div id="scrap-two">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="scrap-two-img text-center pt-4">

            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2 class="scrap-color">1) EXTRA YOUTUBE AD REVENUE: (make money from blogging) :</h2>
            <p>Alright so the
                very first way that my blog makes money is by directing people back to my
                youtube channel which means that my videos get more views and I get more ad
                revenue.
            </p>
            <p>Now obviously this is a really indirect way that my blog makes money but
                it definitely adds a few hundred dollars to my income every single month.
            </p>
            
          </div>
          <span class="end"></span>
        </div>
      </div>










      <div id="scrap-two">
        <div class="container">
            
            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2 class="scrap-color">2) LOVE WORKSHOPS: (make money from blogging) :</h2>
            <p>The second way that I make money with my blog is by offering live workshops almost
              every single month these workshops are typically about 90 minutes long and in
              them I teach my blog readers something that I know they're interested in because
              I publish a blog post every single week I can then go back and look at my
              analytics and see which blog post my readers were most interested in and which
              one got the most traffic and then what I do is I announce that I'm going to
              teach an entire workshop on that topic and I give people a link where they can
              sign up.
            </p>
            <p>I typically charge anywhere between about twenty nine dollars and a
              hundred dollars for people to take part in these workshops.
            </p>
            
          </div>
          <span class="end"></span>
        </div>
      </div>











      <div id="scrap-two">
        <div class="container">
            
            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2 class="scrap-color">3) courses: (make money from blogging) :</h2>
            <p>The third way that my
              blog makes money is a lot like the second way because all I do for this third
              way is I take those workshops that I have already taught and I have recorded and
              I edit them into individual lessons and I turn them into an online course I
              typically sell these courses for a bit more money because they have been edited
              down and I normally add some additional resources to them like workbooks or PDF
              guides to make them a more complete package.
            </p>

            <p>The great thing about selling these
              as courses is it produces completely passive income which means that after I
              finished editing the course and I put it on my website I don't have to do
              anything else and I make money every single month from people going back and
              buying those courses that I've created in the past.

            <h2 class="scrap-color">4) membership site: (make money from blogging) :</h2>
            <p>The fourth way that my blog
              makes money produces the biggest amount of income every month and that is
              through my membership website called startup Society people who read my blog
              sign up for my mailing list and then after they're on my mailing list I tell
              them about startup Society and twice every year I open up start-up society to
              new members.
            </p>

            <p>Startup Society is a membership program that I host on my blog that
              gives people access to a whole suite of resources including all my courses and
              one member exclusive course that is comprehensive course all about how to start
              and run a successful online business like I mentioned startup Society is
              currently the biggest chunk of my monthly income at this point we have about 300
              members inside and they each pay $33 per month.

            <p>The fifth and final way that I make money with my blog is providing coaching and consulting to my
              readers professionally I'm a business marketing strategist and I teach people
              how to start successful profitable online businesses. 
            </p>

            <p>So, a lot of my blog readers
              are interested in starting their own blog or their own YouTube channel or some
              other type of online business so they hire me to teach them how to do that and
              to work with them to build a successful online business together.
              </p>

              <p>This consulting
                work is very profitable but it does require me to invest my time so I am trading
                hours for dollars as people say so I limit myself to only working with about
                five or six clients at a time because I really want to be able to provide them
                the best results and not take up all of my time so that I can keep running my
                blog and running my youtube channel and growing my brand online.
                </p>

                <p>So, that summarizes the five ways that my blog does make money</p>

      <div id="scrap-two">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="scrap-two-img text-center pt-4 mt-5">
                <img src="../img/workfromhome/blog-7.jpg" alt="three ways that I do not make money with my blog" title="three ways that I do not make money with my blog" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <div class="scrap-two-content">
            <h2 class="scrap-color">Now I wanted to talk about three ways that I do not make money with my blog.
            </h2>
            <h2>1) Ebooks:</h2>
            <p>The first way,
              I do not make money with my blog is with ebooks and the reason that I don't do this I guess there's
              two reasons first of all because be books don't sell for very much money I could
              normally package that same information just differently and sell it as a
              workshop or a course and make anywhere between 30 and 300 dollars per sale but
              if I package it as an e-book then it's only gonna sell for you know somewhere
              between ten and thirty dollars at the most.
            </p>

            <p>so, it just wouldn't be very
              profitable and what makes a lot more sense to me is to create great quality
              short ebooks and then give them away for free to use to grow my email list so if
              you're on my blog and you look in the menu you'll see a link that says free
              resources and if you click on that you'll see a collection of ebooks that you
              can download for free if you sign it for my email newsletter subscription.
              </p>

        </div>
      </div>









      <div id="scrap-two">
        <div class="container">
           
            <div class="scrap-two-content">
         
            <h2>2) ADS:</h2>
            <p>The second way that my blog does not make money is with ads and specifically Google
              Adwords now I have nothing against Google AdWords it's a great service for
              certain types of things but I don't think that it's a good way to make money
              with your blog and the main reason is because I think that putting these ads on
              your site really clutters up your blog and makes it not look attractive which
              means that you're gonna not be able to compete with other blogs that look nicer
              than yours and blogging is really competitive.
            </p>

            <p>So, you definitely don't want to do
              something that's gonna make your blog less appealing or less helpful to your
              readers the other reason that I don't put the ads on my site is because they
              don't pay very much people these days are really you know oversaturated by
              advertising they see ads everywhere they go so people don't click on them very
              much which means you need to have tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands
              of visitors to your website every and there's many other ways that you can make
              a lot more money rather than using advertising which makes your website look
              ugly and is sending people away from your blog which is the opposite of what you
              want to do.
              </p>

            <div class="scrap-two-content">
         
            <h2>3) sponsorships:</h2>
            <p>Then the third and final way that I don't normally monetize my
              blog is sponsorships now sometimes I do work with sponsors on my You Tube
              channel but I typically don't for my blog and the main reason why is just
              because most sponsors don't pay that much money but it does require a fair
              amount more time to work with sponsor to hash out all the details and to write a
              post that works well with the sponsor and I just find that my time is better
              invested in other things that can grow my business more and beyond that it's
              just really difficult to find sponsors that are the perfect fit for my audience
              because I really only want to mention a product if it is going to be extremely
              helpful to my audience and something that they would really appreciate and would
              really help them.
            </p>

            <p>Alright so those are the five ways that I make money with my
              blog and also the three ways that I don't.
