             <p>The next type of premium freelance job you
                could do is<span class="text-warning"> editing </span>and here I'm specifically talking about editing, writing now there are many different people who write many different sorts of things as you
                know we live in an age of content and people are writing articles for the web
                they're writing books and all sorts of other things and after someone writes
                anything they really need someone else to go over it and to make sure that it
                looks good enough to publish.</p>
            
             <p> This is especially the case if you're writing
                for a major website or if you are writing a book or something that is going to
                actually go into print there are many people out there<span class="text-warning">who offer editing
                services</span> but a lot of them aren't all that good at what they do and that leaves
                a lot of opportunity for you to step into this field and earn a great hourly
                rate as an editor if you learn how to do this work really well. 
                if you know editing you can earn money online from genuine way. <span class="text-warning">

             <p> The next high
                paying work at home job is that of<span class="text-warning"> writing </span>and I mentioned in the intro that
                general writing doesn't pay all that well in fact if you try to make a living
                writing fiction from home you're probably not even going to be able to support
                yourself unless you happen to make it big but that's okay because there are lots
                of other kinds of writing that you can do that pay a lot better if you do
                <span class="text-warning"> copywriting for ads (or) if you do technical writing</span> then you can earn money anywhere
                between one and five dollars per word that you write.</p>
             <p>I know that might sound
                crazy high because that means if you wrote just a thousand words you'd earn five
                thousand dollars but those really are the rates that we pay to add copywriters
                in the marketing industry. however if you have good knowledge in writing you can earn money online in genuine way.</p>

             <p>Work at home job number five is <span class="text-warning">video editing</span> you
                probably know what this job basically involves people record videos either
                videos like this for YouTube (or) videos that are used as part of movies and these
                videos needs to be edited to have mistakes removed and to turn them into a
                polished finished production now I think this is a great time to interject and
                talk about the fact that a lot of these jobs are a little bit more technical in
                nature and you might not have these skills right now. </p>
             
                <P>This is something that
                    needs to be addressed because I have made videos like this in the past and every
                    time I make one them a lot of people will comment and say that these jobs are
                    unrealistic because they don't have these skills but here's the thing everyone
                    <span class="text-warning"> starts without these skills, everyone starts at zero, everyone has to learn these
                    skills if they want to be able to do these jobs.</span></P>

                    <P>If you want to earn a high
                        hourly rate working from home then you're going to need to learn a more
                        technical skill that's because the more general the type of work that you do is
                        the more you'll be a <span class="text-warning">blue-collar worker </span>and the lower rate you'll earn a per
                        hour but the more technical of work that you do the more niche you are the more
                        specialized you are in the work that you do the more you'll be a <span class="text-warning">white-collar
                        worker </span>and the higher hourly rate you can earn.</P>

                        <P>Video editing the job that I just
                            mentioned is definitely a somewhat technical skill but it's still a skill that
                            most people can learn if they put their minds to it and if you do learn this
                            skill then<span class="text-warning"> you can earn a pretty good way </span>working from home and the better you
                            get at editing and the more advanced you take your skills the more you'll be

             <h2 class="text-uppercase"> 6) podcast production:</h2>
             <P>Next up at number seven is <span class="text-warning"> podcast production,</span>
                Podcasts are becoming more and more popular as time goes on and many
                people are getting hooked on them and as they become more popular<span class="text-warning">
                    more people
                are stepping in to this industry and producing podcasts of their own.</span></P>

                <P>But a lot of these new podcasters and experienced podcasters want some help with creating
                    their shows so they hire a podcast production at come a podcast production
                    company will take care of everything that has to do with actually making the
                    episodes including sometimes planning the podcast episodes and always editing
                    and doing any audio engineering that is required and adding in any promotional
                    clips that want to be included as well as any music into the podcast show's
                    themselves.</P>

            <P>Well this is a technical skill set it is something that I would say
                pays a higher rate than average for the type of work that it is for the level of
                technicality of work that it is because there is being a higher and higher
                demand for podcast production companies and podcast production freelancers and
                there aren't yet very many freelancers offering these services.</P>    
                
              
            <p><span class="text-warning">a)podcast management:</span></p>

            <p>Along the same lines is the another job and that is podcast management so this is a little bit
                different yes it has to do pod-casting as well but instead of actually
                producing the episodes this more has to do with managing the show as a whole
                podcast management involves everything that has to do with getting a show
                created and out into the world.</p>

                <p>So, a <span class="text-warning">podcast manager might help their client plan
                    their episodes</span> get them produced and also publish them on podcast streaming
                    services.</p>

             <p>The podcasts then have to be marketed and that's something else that
                the podcast manager can help their client out with.</p>

                one is a little bit more well-known than a lot of these other jobs and there is
                <span class="text-warning">   a little bit more competition here </span>and so if you really want to stand out and
                make the most money possible as a social media manager you will want to
                specialize you'll want to either offer your services to a particular type of
                client in a particular industry or else you'll want to specialize on a managing
                one particular platform.</p>

                <p>So, instead of just<span class="text-warning"> being a general social media manager</span>
                    maybe you are an<span class="text-warning"> Instagram account manager</span>  (or) a <span class="text-warning">Facebook account manager </span>(or) a
                    <span class="text-warning">YouTube channel manager </span>if you specialize like this then your clients will be
                    interested in paying you more money for your services because they'll see you as
                    more of an expert and they'll expect to get better results because clearly you
                    know that particular platform inside and out.</p>

             <p>The next category of high-paying
                work at home jobs that I'm going to get into is that of<span class="text-warning">consulting jobs,</span> now just
                like the premium freelancer jobs these consulting jobs all mostly look the same
                only now you're not just sitting at a computer in your office all the time now
                you're going to spend half your time sitting in front of a computer working that
                way and the other half of your time talking to clients.</p>

                <p>Because that is what a
                    consultant does<span class="text-warning"> a consultant gives their clients advice on what their clients
                    should do</span> so unlike the premium freelancers that are actually doing the work for
                    the clients the consultants are more just telling the clients what they should
                    do themselves there are endless numbers of different types of consulting jobs
                    out there because people want advice on all sorts of different things and
                    businesses want advice in many different things as well.</p>

                    <p>However what I want to share with you in this articles is two of the highest paying types of consulting this you could potentially do,</p>

            <p><span class="text-warning">a)business strategy or management consulting:</span></p>   
            
            <p>The first one is<span class="text-warning">business strategy (or) management
                consulting</span> this type of consultant consults with businesses and gives them
                advice on what types of business decisions they should make in order to grow
                their business but also on how to better run their companies typically this type
                of consultant will have a background working in corporate management.</p>

                <p>Where they have seen behind the scenes of exactly what works well and what doesn't work so
                    well to run and grow companies so if you happen to have that type of background
                    yourself then you might look into business management and strategy consulting.</p>

                    <p><span class="text-warning">b)marketing consultant:</span></p>

               <p>The other main type of high-paying consulting jobs that you could do working
                from home is being a marketing consultant you could be a Facebook ad consultant
                you could be a sales funnel strategist you could be a copywriting strategist all
                of these are different types of consulting jobs where you are advising these on
                how to better market their products again in order to make the most as this type
                of consultant you will want to specialize and not just be a general marketing
                consultant but choose a specific type of marketing that you become an expert.</p>

            <P>At job number nine on this list is very similar to consulting however it has a
                little bit of a twist instead of just working with one client at a time you work
                with many and this is the job of being a<span class="text-warning"> course creator </span>this is definitely
                something that you can do working from home and it involves creating educational
                courses that you sell to your customers people buy online courses on all sorts
                of different topics.</P>

                <P>Really you would be surprised if you heard some of the
                    topics that people create and buy courses about but two of the most popular
                    categories are continuing education these are courses that help people advance
                    their skills so that they can advance their career and then secondly marketing
                    courses that teach business owners how to better market their services and their
                    products so that they can make more money the reason why these courses are so
                    popular is because they have a direct impact on those businesses and so the
                    business owners are very interested in purchasing these courses because they see
                    it as an investment.</P>

                caution of all of the jobs that I've mentioned here this one definitely has the
                highest potential risk it also has a great potential to earn you a great living
                working from home but all of the other jobs that I mentioned don't require any
                initial investment necessarily and you're still able to earn a great hourly wage.</P>

                <P><span class="text-warning">Drop shipping on the other hand is not only much more risky business </span>but it also
                    requires an initial investment so I'd really only advise going this route if you
                    a have the upfront capital and B can afford to lose it with that being said
                    here's a little bit more information about dropshipping,</P>

                    <P>First of all what is it, 
                        well basically it is when you act as the middleman selling a product to
                        customers that another company actually produces and sends to the customer so
                        you've got this other company that is a manufacturing company they produce some
                        sort of widget then you set up a website the customers can visit to learn more
                        about that widget and to purchase it <span class="text-warning">if a customer buys that widget on your
                        website then you tell the company that manufactures them</span> that that customer
                        bought one and then they ship the widget directly to the customer this is great
                        because you don't have to store the products and you get a cut of the sale
                        what's risky about it though is that first of all it can just be tough to
                        differentiate and to stand out in this market there are a lot of people selling
                        a lot of things online and in order to really stand out and successfully make
                        sales you are going to have to build a complete brand.</P>

                        <P>So, it can see them a
                            little deceptively easy if you just hear that all you have to do is set up a
                            website and then people who will buy stuff from it and that's it <span class="text-warning">but in reality
                            you have to build a brand.</span></P>

            <P><span class="text-warning">The second reason,</span>
                why it's a little bit risky is that
                even though you don't have to store the inventory yourself you typically do have
                to buy some of the product yourself to test it out and you have to keep doing
                that over time to make sure that the quality stays good so that you make sure
                that you're providing your customers with a good quality product.</P>    
                
            <P>All right so we
                have gone through 13 of the highest-paying work at home jobs that are out there
                right now and now I want to address the question of how do you get these jobs
                because like I said at the beginning of this article,</P>  
                
            <P>I always get that question a
                lot so here's what you really need to understand about any of these jobs unlike
                a traditional job where you go to work and you work for an employer a boss with
                all of these jobs you are your own boss you're working for yourself you're
                self-employed.</P>    

            <P>So, how you get these jobs is you get clients you get customers you
                generally aren't applying for these jobs anywhere you are building your own
                business now the difference between most of these jobs that I mentioned and with
                your typical situation where you're building a business is that most of<span class="text-warning">these
                jobs are things that you could do all on your own working from home by yourself.</span></P>  
                
                
            <P>So, even though they are technically businesses they also are jobs in the
                sense that you have to work them every day and in order to make money from them
                you need to put in the hours unlike other types of businesses that you might
                build where you are hiring people under you and you're building systems and over
                time you're able to work less and less and the company can have its own
                management that is just a completely different situation it's something that
                actually I'm really passionate about but it's not for everyone.</P>    

            <P>Some people want to work a job and so that is who this video is really intended for people who
                are looking for a simple job that they can do working from home to support
                themselves and their family so if that sounds like you then I hope that one of
                these thirteen work at home jobs stood out to you sounded like <span class="text-warning">a great
                opportunity to you sounded like something that you would really enjoy doing.</span></P>
