             <h1>Top 23 Ways To Earn Passive Income</h1>
             <p>In this Article I'm going to be sharing with you <span class="text-warning"> 23 different ways that you can
                earn passive income,</span></p>
             
                <p>before we get into them I just want to tell you a couple
                    important things about passive income,</p>

             <p>The first is that passive income always
                requires an initial investment of some sort you can't make something out of
                absolutely nothing so you need to invest either effort (or) time (or) money if you
                want to produce passive income in the future,</p>   
                
                <p>Second thing that I want to know
                    about passive income is that different passive income strategies require
                    different amounts of effort (or) different amounts of time different amounts of
                    money to get started and they also have very different profit potentials some of
                    them can earn you just a little bit of money each month and others could earn
                    you hundreds of thousands of dollars so that's what I'm going to be focusing on
                    in this video is these differences between these 21 different passive income
                    ideas.</p>

                    <p>One last thing before we get into these strategies I'm not a financial
                        adviser and so before investing in any of these opportunities I would highly
                        recommend consulting with a qualified professional.</p>

                 <h2>1) high-yield savings account :</h2>
                 <p>The  <span class="text-warning">first passive income
                    strategy is investing your money in a high-yield savings account</span> now this isn't
                    a strategy that has a very big profit potential typically these high-yield
                    savings accounts only pay about 2.5 percent per year or so however if you do
                    have a large amount of money just sitting around it would be better to put it
                    into a high-yield savings account.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, that it could be earning you some a passive income each and every month.</p>

             <div class="ecom-two-content">
                 <h2>2) Rental properties :</h2>
                 <p><span class="text-warning">passive income strategy number two is rental
                    properties</span> you can buy a real estate and you can rent it out for a profit each month.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now this strategy can be a lot of work if you are managing the properties
                        yourself but it can be a passive income strategy if you outsource the management
                        of these properties to a property management company that does the work for you
                        obviously this is a strategy that requires a fair amount of money invested
                        however I'll let you know that I bought my first rental investment property with
                        just about ten thousand dollars saved in my bank that I'd earned from my job.</p>
                <p>So, you can get started with a moderate financial investment by the way or I
                    continued on with all the rest of these strategies I just want to let you know
                    that if any one of these strategies doesn't appeal to you or wouldn't work for
                    you that's okay because there's a lot of variety with these strategies and I'm
                    sure that if you keep on Reading you'll find one that will match your ability
                    to invest time or money or effort.</p>

                    have a lot of photos out there on stock photo websites however there's a certain

                    already taking a lot of pictures once those pictures are taken and that work is
                    done there's no reason to not take some of those pictures and upload them stock
                    photo websites so that you can earn a little bit of very easy passive income

                    for this one can vary quite extremely some people sell digital courses for very
                    low prices and they don't market them and they don't earn any money from them
                    and other people invested a lot of time and money into the marketing of their
                    products and they sell them for very high prices and they are millions of
                    dollars a year from them so if you're interested in the strategy I would just
                    say do your research and keep on working on improving your systems because you
                    can earn a lot more money than if you put in a minimal effort for this option.

                      once you've set up the website you can forget it and it will pay you a little
                      bit every single month.</P>

                    machines</span> obviously the vending machines require an initial investment you have
                    to buy the machine and then you have to do the initial work of finding a place
                    for your vending machine to be located but once that's done you can do a tiny
                    bit of maintenance every month and collect a paycheck.

                    rely on laundromats as a very necessary part of their lives and if you start
                    laundromat then you will start having regular customers who will be paying you
                    time after time just like with the carwash it's a very simple business that you
                    can easily hire some employees to run for you or you can even set up an
                    automated laundromat that requires very little maintenance once you've made the
                    initial investment of the time and money to setup your laundromat you'll be
                    earning passive income for a long time to come.

                 <p><span class="text-warning">Passive income idea and number 20
                    is an ecommerce site </span>these days Shopify has made it very easy to set up your own
                    shop online where you can sell any sort of product now first this might not
                    sound like a passive income strategy because you might think well I have to get
                    the product and I have to ship it to my customers and that's gonna keep being a
                    headache but there are many people who have e-commerce websites where they sell
                    products that are produced by a different company and are delivered by a
                    fulfillment company.
                    </p>
                    <P>The e-commerce website then orders the product from the
                        production company and the fulfillment company delivers it back to the customer
                        the owner of the e-commerce website never has to touch any piece of the process
                        this type of business has the potential to be highly lucrative however it is
                        fairly competitive and similarly to developing apps most people who make a
                        significant amount of money with e-commerce websites do so after developing a
                        number of different ecommerce websites and having one of them take off and
                        become profitable.</P>

                 <p>My final suggestion for how you can earn passive income is
                    another idea for a simple business that will require a fairly sizable financial
                    investment but will be very simple to run after it is initially set up and that
                    is<span class="text-warning"> starting a storage facility </span>you can either buy a storage facility that
                    already exists or you can buy some land and build a storage facility on it once
                    you have your shortage facility up and running then customers will start to show
                    up and will start paying you month after month to store there are possessions in
                    one of your storage units.
                    </p>
                    <P>Most of the time once people start storing stuff they
                        keep storing it for a long time to come alright so there you have it 21
                        different that you can earn passive income as I mentioned at the beginning of
                        this Article some of them are easier some of them are harder some of them have a
                        very high potential for profit whereas others are only going to earn you a few
                        dollars a month some of them require a lot of advanced skills and others of them
                        anyone can do. </P>
