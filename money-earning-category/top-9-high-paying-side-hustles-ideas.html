                 <h2>1) video editor :</h2>

                 <p>Now the first job on my list is that of video editor now I used to edit my own videos but for the past year or so I've been working with a video editor and let me just tell you it can be really tough to find a good video editor there's a lot less competition online than you might think for video editors that actually know what they're doing as a video editor you can earn anywhere from about 15 dollars an hour all the way up to about a hundred dollars per hour depending on how advanced your skills are and how well you market your services.

             <div class="ecom-two-content">
                 <h2>2) course creator:</h2>

                 <p>The next side hustle on my list is that of course creator now of course Creator is someone who creates online courses so they typically are filming videos and writing lessons and designing assignments and as a course creator one of your biggest jobs is actually just marketing your course so most course creators choose to go the route of building up an audience by running a YouTube channel or a blog or something like that and then once they have an audience they create a course to solve a problem that their audience is facing.
                    </p>

                    <p>Now you don't have to go that route though because you could sell your course on a platform like you to me or you could use Facebook ads to sell your course and if you take one of those options you probably won't be making as much money per sale that you generate but you'll be able to generate sales a lot more easily.</p>

            <p>Online courses sell for anywhere from about 25 dollars all the way up to two or three thousand dollars personally I sell my courses for between 100 and 1000 dollars but there's obviously a wide range here.</p>   
            
            <p>If you are selling on a platform like UDEMY then typically the prices are a lot lower closer to that 25-30 dollar mark whereas if you're selling courses to your own audience and you are working hard on your marketing then you can typically sell them before several hundred if not
                a few thousand dollars.</p>

             <div class="ecom-two-content">
                 <h2>3) YouTube ad strategist :</h2>

                 <p>Alright next job YouTube ad strategist so you might have heard of a Facebook ad manager before this is someone who manages the ads that run on Facebook and they're managing them for clients that are businesses that want to advertise on Facebook however I've been noticing a trend lately there are a lot of Facebook ad strategists out there and Facebook as a platform is on the decline now that does not mean that you cannot still be a successful Facebook ad strategist there's still millions and millions of people on Facebook tons of businesses are still running ads there I just noticed that the field is getting a little bit saturated which is why on this list I'm recommending being a YouTube ad strategist.
                    </p>

                    <p>Right now there's this special situation where YouTube ads are kind of on sale and that's because of a big YouTube advertiser crisis you may or may not know about but long story short about a year ago a bunch of YouTube's biggest advertisers had a little bit of a hissy fit and kind of all ran away.</p>

            <p>So, that left this big opportunity where people could snatch up YouTube ads at a fraction of the price that they used to cost so there are now
                    lots of businesses out there especially a small, local or online businesses that are now taking advantage of this great opportunity however running ads on YouTube is a little bit tricky you have to coordinate the whole video production aspect of it you also have to make sure that you are targeting the right groups on YouTube and you have to manage the ad spend and that's where you can step in help them out and create a great site hustle for yourself.</p>   
            
            <p>YouTube ads strategist generally earn about fifty to two hundred dollars per billable client hour however they generally are charging their clients which are small businesses buy the package so they'll charge them a certain amount to set up the ads or a certain amount per month to
                    manage the ads.</p>

                 <h2>4) Public Notary :</h2>

                 <p>Let's move on to the next side hustle opportunity on my list and that is a public notary now public notaries and loan signing agents do pretty similar jobs and there are also multiple different types of public notaries so make sure that you look into each of these different opportunities.
                    </p>

                    <p>Basically what a public notary does is they watch other people assign legal documents and then they generally sign the document themselves as well to notarize it and make it completely official public notaries charge anywhere between about ten dollars and a hundred and fifty dollars per signing that they witness although they don't get to set their own rates it depends on what state you live in and what type of signing it is.</p>

            <p>Now this might sound like a really technical job that you're definitely not qualified to do but it's actually really easy to become a public notary in order to find out exactly how just google your state's name and then how to become a public notary so for example I live in Oregon so I would search something like how to become a public notary in Oregon but in most states the process is pretty similar first you take a short course and buy a short course I mean of course that takes you several hours not several years once you've taken the course then you pay a fee to take an examination and if you pass then you become a certified public notary in your state.</p>

                 <p>The next site has little opportunity on the list is that of app developer now in order to become an app developer you will have to learn a few coding languages as well as the skills to develop the apps themselves you can learn most of these skills by taking online courses or you can choose to take part in an intensive app development bootcamp these programs typically lasts anywhere from about 12 weeks all the way up to six months and while you're in them they are a full-time job.
                    </p>

                    <p>However by the time you graduate from the program you'll be able to design and develop your own apps which is a highly sought after skill these days.</p>

                    <p>App developers typically earn around $100,000 per year so you could do it full-time or if you want to do it as a side has alt then it would all depend on how many hours you actually want to put into developing apps.</p>

                 <h2>8) small business marketing agency :</h2>

                 <p>The next side has the opportunity is to start your own small business marketing agency whether the economy is up or the economy is down there is always demand for help with marketing and that's because when the economy is up businesses have more money and they want for that money into marketing so that they can grow their businesses even more rapidly.
                    </p>

                    <p>On the other hand when the economy is down they reach out to marketers for help because they know that they desperately need more customers with so many people starting their own businesses over the past few years there are literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of small businesses in need of help finding customers.  You can help these businesses out and create a profitable side hustle for yourself in the process.</p>

                    <p>marketing agencies typically design custom packages for each of their clients and the client pays per month for that package so the package for example might include advertising on Facebook and Instagram or it might include video marketing on YouTube it might also include help with their websites, SEO or all sorts of other digital marketing services.</p>

                    <p>One of the cool things about this opportunity is that you don't have to absolutely everything about marketing before you get started but you can choose just a couple key areas to specialize in for example maybe your marketing agency specializes just in YouTube ads or it specializes in SEO or in paid advertising on Google from there you can continue to expand your services as much as you want and as much as your clients demand of course this is something that you can do as a little side hustle all on your own or you could turn it into a full time job for yourself or you even it could grow it into a bigger business and hire more people to provide the marketing services to your clients.</p>

                 <h2>9) online business manager (or) project manager :</h2>

                 <p>The next side has the opportunity on my list is that of online business manager (or) project manager now I recently hired an online business manager for my own business and it is already having a big impact and I am so glad that I made this decision.
                    </p>

                    <p>Online business managers charge anywhere from around 50 dollars an hour all the way up to $100 an hour and what they do is they help a business to actually get their projects done so for example in my business I serve the role of the visionary I dream the dreams I make the plans and in my business I'm the face of the business to.</p>

                    <p>The business manager (or) project manager on the other hand comesin and they help me make practical plans for my business and then this is the real icing on the cake they take responsibility for making sure that all the boxes get checked and that everyone is communicating well.</p>

                    <p>I can make plans all day long but as a visionary I'm constantly getting distracted by the next shiny thing that I want to go after so it's really helpful for me to have someone kind of rein my ideas in and also take that responsibility off my plate so that I can be free to dream as big as I want to in order to become an online business manager you can take a certification program this program it typically lasts for three to six months at the end of the program you'll be certified and then you can begin accepting clients and while you're taking the program you actually can be accepting virtual assisting clients however I would really recommend that you accept project management clients until you are completely done.</p>
