                  Okay,  through 50 different things that you can do to earn a living without a job. So hopefully somewhere in
                  that list of 50 opportunities, you heard one that really stood out to you. Maybe you even heard a few of them,
                  maybe you need to think about a little bit,
             </p>
             <P>So, all of these different opportunities are things that you do for yourself. You don't have a conventional job,
              you don't work for a boss, but you still have to have someone pay you. And so in order to make these work,
              in order to actually make money with these opportunities, you need to do some things to get people to pay you for them.</P>
              <P>The very <span class="text-warning">first thing</span>  you need to do is have the necessary skills. You need to actually be able to do each of these things. If you can't do them and you can't do them well, then obviously no one will want to pay you for them. So that's step one, "learn the skills and get in the practice".</P>

              <P>Thing<span class="text-warning"> number two</span> is you need to brand yourself. It's not just enough for you to know that you are capable
                of doing these things, you need to somehow communicate that to the world, and specifically to your potential clients.</P>

                <p>So, in order to do that, I would recommend that you start by setting up a website that explains what you do
                  and what your skills are. Once you have the skills and you've started to brand yourself, the third step is to market your services to get clients. So this is where you really get the word out.</p>

                  <p>It's not enough that you know that you can do these things, it's also not enough that on your business card
                    or your website says you can do these things, you need to tell people that you exist, that you are available to work for them. So you need to somehow advertise or market your services.</p>

                    <p>There are lots of different ways to do this. You can do this for free by creating content on your website or on social media or you can invest some money and pay for advertising. Either strategy can work. One of them is cheaper, but takes more time, the other one costs some money, but is a little bit faster and easier.</p>

                    <p>So, you can pick which one really works for you and your situation. Okay, so that's the basics of how to get started with really any of these jobs. Learn the skills, brand yourself, and then work on marketing your service.
                      That is how you will get clients so that you can start earning money.</p>

                      <p>Now, if this is something that you are really seriously interested in pursuing, if you have these skills and you want to start earning money by attracting clients or if you are planning to develop one of these skillsets so that you can get started with these opportunities and you need some guidance, maybe you're not sure how to brand yourself or how to start attracting clients, you don't know what to write on your website or how to market your services, then I would love to invite you to join Startup Society.</p>

                      <p>Startup Society is a membership community and training program that teaches you all the basics of starting
                        and growing an online business. So if you want to make money online and learn how to work from home, then this is the place for you.</p>

                        <p>Now, gonna be completely upfront, you're not gonna learn the skills that you would need in order to do any of these jobs. So, you need to already have some skills or you need to have something that you want to share on a website or on social media. You need to have something of value that people will want to pay your for. But if you have a product or a service that you want to sell, and the problem that you're facing is just finding that connection between your product and the customers, finding the customers, getting the word out, then a Startup Society can really help you out.</p>
