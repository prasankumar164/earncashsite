             <div class="ecom-two-content">
                 <h2>1) Amazon flex :</h2>
                 <p>What amazon flicks is first of all they pay you between 18 to $25 per hour which is a really good wage if you think about it that's that's above minimum wage and you are essentially a delivery man so Amazon you go on the application and they deliveries come up and you can put in your own schedule and you it's like an uber for but for delivery for Amazon so you go pick up the box and you go and take it to the person there they purchase that product and you get paid a fee (or) an hourly rate for doing that job now the reason I like this is because it's easy if you go to like uber if you go to but you have to interact with people in a car and stuff like that but something like Amazon flicks you just pick something up you drop it off easy done deal you get paid your hourly rate (or) however you get paid and it's really good and you just simply just go to Amazon (or) flex amazon.com you sign up and you can go and put in your hours and you can start earning a side income from doing this. 
                    </p>

             <p>If you're maybe on your way to work on you at a school on your way home you can pick up a package and drop it off and you'll get paid to do that so number one guys this isn't in any specific order but number one probably one of my favorites is going to be Amazon flex because it's really easy for anybody to do now.</p>

                 <h2>2) Lime :</h2>
                 <p>Number two is also a favorite of mine and people are making a roundabout well here in New Zealand around about a hundred dollars per day doing this which is extreme good to see you looking like like if you did the seven days a week you you'll be making like seven hundred bucks a week. but you could easily make three four hundred dollars a week two hundred dollars a week by going out and charging scooters lime scooters bird screws and stuff like that you simply go and sign up on the application as a charger and you go and pick up these scooters and you charge them overnight and then you drop them back to this designated locations the next day.
                    </p>

             <p>So, people can go and use the scooters this is once again a great our way to make a side hustle because you don't really interact with anyone you just go and pick up the scooters you take them home you charge them you take them back and that's it and you get paid and people are making
              up - or round about a hundred dollars per day doing this so essentially it can be a side income. actually be a full-time job if you wanted to go and put the effort in and make this a full-time job however I do know that to make the hundred dollars a day plus you do need to be charging a lot of scooters overnight so you'll need a truck or a ute or something that you can use to pick up a lot of scooters and bulk or a trailer so if you do want to make good money over $100 a day doing this trading scooters you will have to think big but but you can't go and make a little bit of money maybe 50 bucks a day 30, 40 bucks a day charging a few schooners overnight.</p>

                 <p>Number three guides is also a great way to make a side income and I actually pay someone to do this for me so if you go into your local Facebook groups in your area there'll be people advertising their businesses and one that I see all the time is car washing so not so long ago it will actually once every couple of weeks they get this guy to come and wash my car I pay him around about $200, 200 hours.

             <p>Because I have multiple cars and also have an exotic car so he has to be careful that one it's cost a little bit extra but I found him in a Facebook group guys and all he does I said to him how do you get most of your business and he said all I do is post in facebook groups telling people I can wash their cars so you can you don't have to have really much skills to wash your car it's very easy and you can just go and get
              your bucket your sponge and all that sort of stuff there's water at their house and you can go put up advertisements on Facebook groups offering to wash people's cars and I've seen multiple people do this inside Facebook groups and I've paid a pay my guy around about $200 for two hours of work I don't know how much of this he does every good day but it's definitely a good side hustle. </p> 
              
              <P>If you want to do it on the weekends or after work or after school or something like that you can simply go and watch people's cars now typically we right where I am you're looking at around about $80 per car to wash your car and you can usually do one car within an hour to wash cleaner inside and stuff like that so that's myth number three guys is to go out and start a car washing side hustle or lawn mowing or anything like that but use Facebook groups to go and get your clients now.</P>

                 <h2>4) garage sale flipping :</h2>
                 <p>Number four guys is probably one of my favorites as well and this is called garage sale flipping so essentially a guy called Gary Vee talks about this quite a lot he's quite popular essentially you go to garage sales you find something for cheap when you're trying to go she ate a deal and you flip it on eBay and stuff like that for profit now this over the last couple of years has become a very lucrative business model people have gone from doing a side hustle with this to making businesses there worth millions or even six figures per month people literally go out and buy so much stuff in garage sales and they put it on eBay and stuff like that for a big markup and they make a full-time living out of this so you can do garage sale flipping you can make I do a full-time income.
                    </p>

             <p>If you like or a side hustle but of course I would depend on the area you live in because it might not be a lot of garage sales and stuff like that but number four guys is going to be garage sale flipping this is really easy to do guys you don't need much money for this apart for them to buy the products but you're gonna get that money back and a little bit of gas money to drive around to the garage sales to go and pick up the items. </p>

                 <h2>5) Drop shipping :</h2>
                 <p>Number five I'm doing right now and that is called drop shipping. drop shipping is something will you sell a product that you don't have yet online and then once someone makes a purchase you go to your supplier you pay your supplier and they ship out the product.
                    </p>

             <p>Now the reason I put drop shipping into a side hustle guys is because you can you know I have students inside my training who are making $100 a day and some that are making I don't know ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a day so drop shipping can be a side hustle or it can be a full-time income depending on how much work you want to put in it's dependent on your of course so but you can definitely make a hundred dollars a day 50 bucks a day even thirty dollars a day you can make some good money I know someone right now making $2,000 per month doing drop shipping and just as a side hustle on top of their job so drops is definitely up there with some of the best side hustles in the game right now or you can actually do it as a full-time living now.</p>

                 <p>Number six is renting out your car on a website called Turo.com now this is an American website I assume I'm not sure we don't have this in my country but you can go out and you can actually rent your car when you're not using it so I have multiple cars that I don't use if I wanted to I could go and rent them out I'm not sure how much you make per day but you can go and rent these out oh there you go $44 per day, 56 dollars per day, $44 per day, obviously this website would take a cut of those profits but you can go and reach your car's out and make a few hundred dollars per week. 
                    </p>

             <p>If you're not using your cash so for example if you go to work and you take public transport and you leave your car at home and maybe you drive your car once a week or something you can rent it out for those days that you're not using your car so there will be number six guys and it's a great way to just get some extra cash on the side if you're not using your car and you want to go and rent it out to people and there's this probably isn't the only website goes there's probably other applications and websites you can use to go and rent out your car.</p>

                 <p>Number seven is one of my favorites because I hire people to do this for me all the time and that is called chat bot support so with the you know Internet's really booming right now there's lots of software's coming out there's lots of people dropping courses there's really a lot of people selling stuff online well we need support teams so we hire people to sit online and reply to people on our chat BOTS and do support now I pay my guys around about fifteen to eighteen dollars per hour some of them are a little bit more depending.
                    </p>

             <p>If they're a manager or not but you can go out there guys and you can earn I think at least fifteen dollars or more per hour being a chatbox support person and it's simple you don't you don't really need any skills like what my guys do is they just reply to general questions and then if the questions are too hard they forward those questions on to my manager and he takes care of the rest or even to me and I take care of the risk so a chatbot support us is someone that is essentially a middleman helping people with general questions then the harder questions get forwarded up  the letter and we sort it out so that's a great side hustle guys for someone that you know it likes to type you just type in answer questions so that's a chatbox support you can go online and just type checkbox support and there are hundreds of jobs you can apply for to be a chatbot support put a person or customer support whatever you want to call it for websites companies software companies and all that sort of stuff so that's a great start hustle if you have zero money in the morning on start making some money online.</p>

                 <h2>8) Uber eats:</h2>
                 <p>Number eight is very common now this is uber eats I'm not going to include uber itself because ruber itself you have to actually interact with a lot of people people sit in your car and I love it I know that a lot of people might be socially awkward like I am and you might not want to sit with people all day long so we're gonna add an uber each because this is simple you go and pick up food you put that food in your car you drop it up to somebody and the human interaction is very minimal so it's great for anybody even if you're an introvert and stuff like that so uber eats is good because once again you can do this in your spare time when you're driving around driving a work driving home driving to school and stuff like that so I think  has better than ruber itself because you know you there's not so much interaction and with uber itself there's so many chicks you have to grow through with uber eat so it's a little bit different there's not as many chicks you have to go through to get a job with uber eats.
                    </p>

             <p>So, I recommend uber eats and actually on the news yesterday I was watching a thing how uber eats is just blowing up right now and more and more people ordering food to their house so the work is never going to slow down and you're always going to have work and you can do it whenever you want you're on your own time schedule.</p>

                 <h2>9) Rent out a car park space (kerb.works):</h2>
                 <p>Other side hustle that I find very fascinating I didn't actually know you could do this I was just kind of came up and I was researching topics on this article is to rent out a car park space so this is a website called  kerb.works this is in my country I'm not sure if it's worldwide but I assume that most countries would have this application or website and you can rent out car park spaces so if you live close to town or close to like a stadium or close to anything that requires a lot of car parking you can rent out your driveway you know if you have some a lawn at your house you can rent out the lawn and people can come and park on your property and you get paid for doing there. 
                    </p>

             <p>So this is great for events I remember when I was younger I used to go and watch cricket and at the stadium and everyone would have signs out ten dollar parking on my lawn ten dollar parking on my driveway well now you can do it with an application and it's so easy like you don't even have to do anything you just say you just go and list yourself on there as a person with the car park and someone can come and rent a car park off you you it's not like rinsing out a car where you have to give someone your car you're just giving someone a bit of space so that's a great way guys to go out and make some money on the side without having to give anything up like a car or your time it's literally just free money or the only time you need is to actually go and log on to the site sign up and do all that stuff but once that's all done you just use the application on the website whatever one you're using to go and rent out space at your property that's a great side hustle if you live near somewhere that requires a lot of parking and maybe there's a lot of expensive parking around.</p>

                 <p>Number ten I also pay a lot of people to do this for me as well and this is writing for people so you can go to a website called iwriter.com  and you can write content for people all the time and there's always content to be written so go and sign up as a writer and then literally every single date is go and check and they'll be people asking for content for you to write you don't need to be that great at writing because a lot of the times the people buying it will just edit it anyway but you can sign up to the site guys iwriter.com
                    </p>

             <p>You can go and write content for people now anyone can write anyone can use a computer or laptop it's really easy to do and they they will send you the topic how many words they want and you can just go and research the topic that would take long you can start writing the content and then you can say hey the job's done and they will pay you and you will get paid to write content once again this is a really easy thing to do for a side hustle there's no upfront money there's no upfront products that you need to like car that you need to rent out or anything all you need is time so you're just getting paid for your time you're not putting in any of your own money or capital to get this side hustle started so writing for someone is an extremely good way to make some side income.

                 <p>Rent a friend now I wasn't sure if I was going to add this one in but essentially what you can do is you can go out and hang out with people so there might be someone that's new to you your city they've come for a holiday maybe they're tourists maybe they want to know where the best restaurants and hang out with somebody well you can go and rinse yourself out as a companion or someone to hang out with these people and show them around your town and stuff like that and once again it's just a time thing you're only getting paid for your time so if you're a social bunny you like to interact with people we like to hang out with people go out and have a good time and you like to meet new people this would be a great way for you to go out and interact with people and get paid to do it at the same time so rent a friend is a pretty good way of making some money on the side there's probably multiple web sites you can go out and make money doing them.

                    </p>

                    <P>Every single date they list domain so you can buy you can usually buy them around about $69 all the way up to $200 depending on how good they are and some of them you can sell for two thousand three thousand I've even sold them up to ten thousand dollars in even more in some cases so that's a great way guys but the only problem with that is you need upfront capital to buy the domains and sometimes they do take a while to sell so domain flipping is not for everybody but it definitely is a great way to make some money on the sites you go and research how to do domain flipping essentially you're buying domains that people will want in the future for their business you're holding onto them or you're going to go resell them straight away for a profit and it's called domain flipping it's kind of like online realestate.</P>
