                 <p><span class="text-warning">The first way you can save money is by saving your spare change </span>whenever you pay with cash make sure you
                    get the change and you put it in the same spot every time. If you don't put it in the same spot then it's just going to be spread all over your house in your car and it will never seem to really add up but if you put it in the same spot over and over again say a jar on your kitchen counter or maybe you even have a piggy bank then it will really add up and you can eventually use it to buy something that you actually want.

                <p><span class="text-warning">The fifth way that you can save money is by practicing the 30 day rule </span>now the 30 day rule is just this whenever you think that you want to buy something maybe you're in a store and you see some clothes that you want to buy or you see a gadget that you think you need or maybe you're even online looking around on Amazon and you see something that you think you want to buy instead of just impulsively buying it right then make yourself wait 30 days if it's something that you really want you'll still want it 30 days later and you'll still remember it 30 days later so stick to your budget buy the things that you've planned on buying but for anything that you spontaneously want to spend money on make yourself wait 30 days.</p>

                    isn't something that's going to cost you money it could be as simple as playing a board game or doing an art project with them.

                    telling myself I would spend and so not only was I trying to learn the habit of keeping a budget but I was also trying to at the same time completely shift my lifestyle and become really frugal all at once I realized that I needed to be realistic about how much money I was actually going to spend on different categories and instead of trying to go on a diet I needed to just start tracking and then over time I could work on adjusting that budget to shape my habits.
