             <h1>Top 11 High Paying Jobs You Can Learn And Do From Home</h1>
             <p>Today's Article I am going to tell you about some jobs that you can learn and do from home anywhere in the world all the things that you need are the internet and probably a laptop in some cases but I have tried my hand at quite a few of them and in some cases I used to use a mobile I only got a laptop like last year December so that means like six months with a laptop so before that I used to use only my phone my mine
              was a Lenovo 7000 I think it cost about eight or ten thousand when I bought it a few few years ago so it was a very basic phone but it helped me get started in my freelance journey I work from home Jonny why I decided to work from home is because I did not have a lot of time to travel and also like I'm a student so it's really difficult to have a nine-to-five job while you're studying.
             </p>

             <p>That's the reason why I picked it up but there are several are the benefits of work from home including you will be able to decide how many people you work for you'll be able to decide what your income will be and lastly you will be able to decide where you work from especially if you don't like commuting to work place yes this is the best way to go about your career now I am going to tell you about the ten jobs without any further ado there will be a few bonuses as well make sure that before you decide which of these you want to pursue you do plenty of research on your own.</p>

             <div class="ecom-two-content">
                 <h2>1) content writing :</h2>
                 <p>content writing is basically writing content. It can be any type of content that you want to write that is basically for someone who have a website, someone who needs content on the website and they country United themselves so they are going to pay you to write their content so if it's a lifestyle our website,
                    </p>

            <p>they probably ask you to make lifestyle related content like home decor (or) food,</p>  
            <p> if it's a book website they will ask you to write essays (or) reviews (or) lists of books, </p>  <p>if it's a travel related website they'll probably ask you to write about travel,</p>  
            <p> if it's a medicine related website and medicine is one of the most high paying niche ever they will ask you to write about medicinal articles</p>  

            
            <p>and as easy as this sounds it takes a lot of time for research also you have to make sure that your articles are not plagiarized that to no more than three words in a row are the same - same with any other existing article on the Internet and considering that there are plenty of articles on the Internet it's really difficult also you really need to learn SEO if you want to advance your career in content writing.</p>

            <p>That's basically the drill of content writing most of the people that I have worked with so I have a freelance consultancy so most of the people who want consultancy from me they have been doing content writing for a long time right now the standard rate is 50 paisa or more but a lot of them are also working at really rates lower than that well if you are getting started that's okay but in the long run you should not charge less than 50 paisa up our word if you are in content writing.</p>

                 <h2>2) copywriting :</h2>
                 <p>Copywriting is mostly something that you will be able to do for international clients I have not seen a lot of Indian clients looking for copy online but internationally copywriting is one of the most in-demand skills copywriting is basically writing sales pages mostly in a way that convinces the person who wants to you know check out the product to buy it what is sales copy have you ever checked out a course page have you ever checked out a sales page it's can be of a product if it can be offer digital product as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>You will see that they have described the product they have told you why you need that product they have told you things about what they are what they do they have told you about the testimonials what other people who have bought their service a product I've got basically all that is a sales copy it is meant to convince the person who reads it to actually buy it and sales copy does not take as much time as content writing does for the same rate but it takes a lot of strategy and skill to understand what would the reader need to read so that they actually buy from you so that is why copywriting pays more in terms of time because it's not about how much you write it's about the strategy you use in writing.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you can write good sales pages and it brings your customer or client revenue every time someone actually checks that sales page out it
                      is going to make you rich very soon if you're good at sales if you want to be good at sales you need to learn copywriting and copywriting is not only going to help you get an online job it's also going to help you in real life because you'll know what are the things that you need to say to get a job done to get someone to buy from you and sales is the biggest scale in this entire world whole world is built upon sales, if you know how to make those sales your life is sorted.</p>

                 <h2>3) virtual assistant :</h2>
                 <p>A virtual assistant charges somewhere between $15 per hour to $25 per hour on an average if you're working for international clients and I'm talking mostly about international clients because that's the market I deal with because it's really easier to reach your money goals while dealing with an international client base now virtual assistants basically do a lot of things and it can be advanced things that it can be not so advanced things like writing an email or shedueling things keeping the incoming and outgoing cash flow it can be managing the social media it can be keeping an track of the money in the business it can be so many things.
                    </p>

                    <p>Basically if someone has a business they need someone to keep a track of all the things that they do all the things they need to do and they can't do it all themselves so they had a way a virtual assistant and you basically communicate online and they'll tell you what are the
                      things you need to do and you'll basically need to do that now it depends on the level of skill that you're offering you are offering services like editing, funnel creation, these are very advanced things so in this in these case your rates can be higher than the average but you are offering very basic services like social media marketing, like sending out emails, like calling people up, these are sort of basic
                      services. </p>
                    
                    <p>So, you might not get paid that high virtual assistants are mostly paid by the hour of work and not by the month so make sure that you know how many hours a month you have so that you can calculate your money goods and how you can reach them.</p>

                 <h2>4) Digital marketing :</h2>
                 <p>Specifically I'm in social media marketing but digital marketing is a whole umbrella and social media marketing comes under it I basically do ads and YouTube but there are a lot of other services that clients need if they want to market their business now when people build businesses it's no use if they don't have customers and marketing is basically sort of a bridge which brings the customer to the client of yours and if you are good at it it is the only thing a business needs apart from a product and client and I know how it sounds it sounds like marketing is the best thing in the world but it is really hard it's really hard to understand how do you get the clients and once you do understand it your whole business will be sorted but just getting to that point is very very difficult but once you've learnt it it will be simple.
                    </p>

                    <p>I personally took a course which is called the marketing as accelerator Academy six months ago and I have been making consistent revenue ever since I think the month of April because I  took about three months to learn the basics of marketing in Facebook ads and Instagram ads I knew all about  YouTube but that was not a part of the module but that's also something that I offer to my clients because YouTube is something that I know about so you can totally decide what are the fields in marketing you want to cater to if social media interests you if Facebook interests you will love this job the best part about it is that you will get to explore in so many amazing niches the needs that I am working in now is solar and I'm so interested in this I had never idea I will be working in the solar industry for marketing but I am doing it now and it very very interesting. </p>
                    
                    <p>I would love to tell you more about my work but I can't really do that for every monthly project you can charge at least 300 dollars from your client and I try to take about three clients not more than that per month so reaching $1,000 per month is not really difficult for me and if any month I want to take on more clients I'd probably do that but for now I have my studies so I am NOT going deep into it but digital marketing is what I what I see myself pursuing further but I have also learnt a lot about content and copywriting.</p>

                 <h2>5) Funnel expert:</h2>
                 <p>If you don't know what a funnel is please Google it up but if I want to give you a drill a funnel is basically a series of steps which takes a visitor from just knowing about your product to actually buying your product so let's talk about maybe you want to buy a bottle on Amazon tea okay so you'll probably search button and then you'll find the bottles page the or Amazon probably you click it and you go to the bottles page you check out a lot of bottles that is the second step of step of the funnel you click on the image of the bottles that you liked the most that is the third step of the funnel and then you click Add to Cart that is the fourth step of the funnel and you know between the first four steps a lot of people will not reach the fourth step maybe this checked out the bottles didn't like it they left on the second page maybe
                  they added it to cart but somebody called them up and they got busy and they didn't buy the product and if they finally add it to cart and then checkout and they reach the fifth page and then obviously after the order confirmation is the sixth page this is basically a funnel. 
                    </p>

               <p>Funnels can be as less as three pages it can be order page bye and thank you it can be a long set of pages as well for example the online courses that we have usually it's a long set of funnel starting from an ad that people see and then they click the ad they register for a free a freebie or a free webinar and they once they are enrolled in the webinar they see the webinar that is probably the fourth or fifth page by
                then and then after watching the webinar they find out about the product of the created the webinar and then after finding it out we send them emails then after clicking on the email links they go to the page of buying and then they decide if they want to buy or not if they don't buy then we retarget them with Facebook Ads.</p>    
                
                <p>So, this is a very long process and people don't know how to do it they don't know about funnels funnels is basically so simple right but you need to learn how to make good funnel pages and if you want to the best way to go about it will be learning click funnels which costs about $100 per month to try out but I really think once you've mastered it there's no turning back like you can make earnings like literally thousands of dollars per project I don't know how many projects you'll take per month.

                 <h2>6) Consultant :</h2>
                 <p>This is sort of an advanced level job and I'll suggest this only for people who have worked for some time in a particular industry you basically become a consultant for that industry and people who want to know more about it who have decisions to make who want your expertise will come to you for your opinion.
                    </p>

               <p>If you're charged on your you know expertise you can charge them anywhere from between $50 to $100 per hour on an average to give you an idea but it can be much more than that I know a lot of people who charge 500, 2000 dollars even per hour because they are such experts this takes you some time to get started with currently I charge about $50 to $100 per hour for consultancy and I have experience of about 1 to 2 years approximately across the fields that I work in.</p>     

               <p>That is basically to give you an idea so if you have any idea about a field if you have worked in a particular field if you have expertise there are people who need your expertise now you might ask me why will someone pay you to just talk to them you are not offering them your time you're offering them there your expertise if they were to venture out in the world and find out these things on their own they will waste as weeks or even months or even years of their time if don't know what lies ahead you basically help them reduce their wasted time when
                time equals to money and compared to the night time their way they would have wasted if they had not talked to you you're getting paid a lot less. </p>

                 <p>There are a lot of people who want to ters and search for them online I once upon a time was an online tutor and I used to give English lessons online, English speaking lessons my clients mostly were people who had to go abroad but don't know how to speak English properly and somebody they know would actually get them in touch with me it was quite fun to do there was once this Aunty who I talked to it and she was
                  really sweet.
                    </p>

                <p>I am diving into a story but basically I was asking the Aunty to tell me a story of her life a memorable event of her life in English so that I can help her out and she said that she doesn't have any memorable events that was quite funny but anyway coming back online tutoring is something that a lot of people are looking for nowadays and it is increasing everyday because people don't want to leave their home so if you are expert in any subject please  enroll for any online tutoring website it is usually free some of them actually charge I don't remember exactly which website I signed up at because it was a long time ago if you know coding if you are good with websites which I am clearly not you can get into the career of website designing.</p>

                <p>I don't know how how much you get paid for that I don't have a lot of experience in this industry so I have only talked to a few people who are into web designing and this is the average charge that they charge so my view is very high in this matter but if you're good with websites I don't think there's any reason you should not venture into this industry and if you're not there are a lot of courses like for all of these there are so many courses online that will help you get started with learning these and doing these from home the.</p>
