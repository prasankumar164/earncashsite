              teenagers can make money online using third method. This is one of our favorite things in the world people who can pull this off our real entrepreneurs and they've got that hustle gene that most gurus always talk about but why do we like it so much basically you learn how to see value where others don't and this skill alone can make you rich in life couple it with dedication discipline and a continuous study of the industry and you can build something real Sophia Amoruso started Nasty Gal immediately after college she bought vintage clothes and resold them on eBay things who went well she began a simple online shop like the one you can start as well by going to alux.com/sell and signing up because we are with Shopify you get to play around with the store for 14 days more than enough to get your first sale at one point she was worth two hundred and eighty million dollars before selling her company another great example we love is Benjamin Hicks who at only 16 years old became a millionaire from hooking up celebrities with rare sneakers he kept on buying and selling them this is that hustle gene most people don't have that ability to connect the dots others can't see or are just not willing to put in the work.

              teenagers can make money online using fourth method People are willing to pay for all kinds of things the thing is you don't know exactly what for that's where the entrepreneurial gene kicks in going door to door and talk into your neighbors about how you can help them out is yet another incredibly valuable skill that not only will get you paid right now but will teach you what you need for the future protip find things that may need fixing that you would be willing to take care of and then talk to them about it from painting fences cutting grass fixing up a shed you might be laughing right now but that's the subtle arrogance in you that you need to control before you can make any real progress.
