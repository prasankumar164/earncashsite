                 <p class="pt-4">But those methods don't really work in truth why the basic idea of making money (or) commerce is that you're
                    exchanging value with other people so you are giving them something of value and in return they are giving you money which is also something about you that's a fair exchange every sales transaction works in this way someone gives you money and you give them a service or a product that is how all sales happen so any method of making money where you're not giving up value in exchange for making that money you know probably won't work and probably isn't very ethical but all of the methods that I'm going to share with you today in this article for how to earn money on Facebook are completely legitimate.
                    </p>
                    <p>You're going to be giving a lot of value to other people either in form of services or product or helping them in some way and in exchange you can earn my facebook present an incredible opportunity because it is the biggest gathering of people that has ever happened in history and it's the biggest gathering that's currently happening today now what I mean by that is that there are 1.9 billion users on Facebook and all those people are connected via Facebook and using Facebook you can talk to all of them whenever you have something of value that you were trying to exchange for money so that you can make money the biggest difficulty that most people run into is getting the word out you know telling people that have this thing and why it's valuable but Facebook pretty
                        much completely solves that problem because they provide a means for you to be able to connect with other people you can do this by just networking on Facebook or you can use powerful tools like Facebook Ads or networking in inside of Facebook groups to supercharge those effect so without further ado let's jump in to the first idea of how to make money on Facebook.

             </div>
             <div class="ecom-two-content">
                 <h2>1) promoting an e-commerce product :</h2>
                 <p>That is by promoting an e-commerce product now before you think oh I don't have any product to sell I don't know how to make a product I don't want to store inventory and everything like that I just want to say that it is
                    actually quite simple idea is probably one of the easiest ways I've ever made money myself and just because it is so simple and you don't have to keep inventory at all so what it is is basically drop shipping so you set up a simple website such as a Shopify store and then you find a supplier who has a product that they want to sell you advertise the product on your website and then you promote that product on Facebook and then whenever someone
                    decides to buy that product you simply give their information their address their shipping address Overson employer that supplier ships it directly to the customer.
                    </p>

                    <P>So, all you're doing is helping the customer buy that product fear centrally being a business middleman now
                        this idea the sky really is the limit of how much money you could make with this it all depends on what products you choose how will you promote it and how high your out-of-pocket cost for the product is how much are you paying for it how much are you selling it for if this is something that sounds interesting to you.</P>

             <P>Basically all you need to do is first set up a website like I said you can use the service like Shopify they make it really easy and so that the processing is payments goes very smoothly and then you find a product that you want to sell you can use a service or a website like Aliexpress that connects you with a whole lot of distributors internationally once we found the product into one so you just add that product to your website I would recommend if you add several different products that all are similars they're all in the same category for example a whole bunch of different Gulf products or a whole bunch of different makeup products whatever it is that you're interested in and you see as a good opportunity.</P>  
             
             <P>Once your store is completely ready to go then you can start promoting it on Facebook you can either share your products in groups talk about them on your timeline or you can use the power of Facebook ads to talk to thousands and thousands of people for literally pays each when you order share it rolling in all you need to do
                is tasty information that the customers give when they check out turn around and give it to the supplier then the
                supplier will ship that product to the customer and you'll keep the difference between the web customer paid and once you have to pay the supplier like I said this really is a quite easy way to make money it does require of course some skill with the marketing of it and you might find a product that done really well or you might have to try a few products before you find one if it is a good fit but keep at it because there are lots of people making their full-time income in this way on Facebook.</P>

                 <h2>2) affiliate marketing :</h2>
                 <p>The next opportunity is affiliate marketing now if you've heard this before you might know that there are a few different types of affiliate marketing basically even either be selling digital products or it can be selling physical products now what affiliate marketing is is actually kind of similar to drop shipping except you're
                  not processing the sale yourself So, someone else is selling something you refer a customer to them if the customer purchases then you get a cut of the profit now that cut can range anywhere from about four percent all the way up to a hundred percent just depending on the type of product but normally physical products pay about four to eight percent and digital products pay around 50 percent of a selling price. 
                    </p>

                   <p>So, if you refer a customer to buy a digital product that costs $100 you would get $50 and if you refer a customer to buy physical products that cost $10 you would get about 40 cents now there are lots and lots of different companies that offer affiliate programs where they pay you if you refer customers to them some of the most common opportunities for selling affiliate products include amazon.com which obviously sells mostly physical products and you can refer customer to buy any of their hundreds of thousands of products and you would get a commission for any of them they normally pay between four and eight percent depending on how much you
                    sell the more product you sell the greater a commission they pay you which is pretty cool another opportunity is a lot of software as a service companies will pay about 50% or some of them even paying ongoing fee so for example if you refer someone to a web hosting company or an email service provider then you could anywhere from about ten dollars all the way up to a hundred dollars.</p>

                    <p>Finally, there are several different websites on which you can find a whole host of different digital products sell all from different creators these products normally gives you between fifty and seventy-five percent commission on the price of the product but you do have to sift through them because some of them are not very high quality so you'll want to make sure that you test any product before you are referring people to it so
                      that you don't accidentally refer someone to a product that isn't very good and that would damage your reputation.</p>

                 <h2>3) sell a service :</h2>
                 <p>He third way that you can make money on Facebook is to sell a service so you probably have a lot of different things that you can do that people would be really happy to pay you for for example maybe you could, transcribe audio into text (or) you could do social media management, maybe you can edit pictures (or) manage someone's email INBOX,
                    </p>

                   <p>People are looking for others to provide these services for them and their simple services that anyone can offer so if you decide to offer one of these services you can share on Facebook that you are offering the service and
                    your friends are more than likely to take you up on it if they want to hire someone to do that service beyond your friends you can also share in groups about what you do you can even run Facebook ads to get more clients.</p>

                    <p>But this is the way that many people do earn their full-time incomes by just promoting themselves on Facebook I
                      personally have a lot of friends who earn their entire income this way and I definitely earned a portion of mine as well.</p>

                 <h2>4) sponsoring posts :</h2>
                 <p>The fourth way to earn money from Facebook is completely different and it is sponsoring posts so if you love a
                  large following I would say anywhere from about an audience size of 10,000 followers or more on any platform then there are a lot of companies who would be interested in working with you so that you can promote their products for them now this might be a picture of their product on your newsfeed it might be writing a recommendation and posting it on your feed it might be you showing pictures of yourself using that product throughout your daily life however they sponsorships are formatted companies are interested in paying you
                  anywhere from $10 all the way up to about $2,000 for you to be the face of the and to promote their product to your followers.
                    </p>

                   <p>How much they're willing to pay entirely depends on how large your audiences how engaged your audiences and how targeted they are so if you have a whole bunch of followers who are very interested in a specific thing that
                    relates to the product and they are very active community where they're talking to you and talking to each other then brands would love to work with you even if you only have a few hundred or a few thousand followers people still might be interested in working with you if your audience is very active and engaged if they're less active and engaged than you two probably need at least 10,000 but there are still a lot of companies who are interested in working with you to promote their products and to grow their own audience.</p>

             <div class="ecom-two-content">
                 <h2>5) create and sell digital products yourself :</h2>
                 <p>The fifth and final way that you can make money on Facebook is to create and sell digital products yourself so maybe you could create an e-book that teaches someone a skill or an e-book that is a story anything you want you can create an e-book or a course and then you can sell it on your website or you can even sell it on Amazon or
                  another third-party marketplace.
                    </p>

                   <p>Once you've created your product you can sell it on Facebook I have the routines book ads or again by sharing it in Facebook group on the one hand this is almost the easiest opportunity because you don't have to deal with physical products at all and you can scale indefinitely because you can sell as many copies of the digital product as you want and you'll never have amendment or issue.</p>

                   <p>On the other hand digital products do tend to be a little bit harder to sell because it's harder to convince people that they are worth their money because it's an intangible people can be a little bit hesitant and a little bit concerned that it might not be worth paying for however that means that there are plenty of people who make six figures a year selling online courses or even ebook.</p>

                   <p>So, if you have expert knowledge or even just above the dinner average in any specific area there are probably people interested in learning about that topic or learning how to do what you do maybe you could even teach people how to do the job that you do whether it's a day job or a freelance job you can package your expertise into a court or a book and then promote it with Facebook ads or in groups.</p>

                   <p>So, that pretty much covers the five different ways that you can make money on Facebook I know that none of
                    these are completely automat or completely hands-free but honestly there isn't such a thing as making money without putting out any effort because you really have to be providing value to others in exchange for that money that they're giving to you.</p>

                    <p>Now that's not saying that there isn't something as passive income there definitely is once you create that value in the first place like maybe you create an online course and you can continue to sell it indefinitely and once you do the initial advertising works it could grow by word of mouth and you could have to not do any more work in the future but all of these ideas and every other way you would make money does require some work upfront money doesn't grow on trees right.</p>
