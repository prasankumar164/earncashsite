              <h2 class="text-uppercase">5 Genuine ways you can make money from youtube</h2>
              <p>Today I will tell you <b> how to make money from you tube.</b> So, of course, we know that if you get millions of views or you have a huge audience that you can actually make pretty good money on YouTube but what do you do if you have a small channel or you're just starting out in this website I'm gonna be breaking down five practical ways to <b class="text-warning"> make money on YouTube. </b>Even if you have a small audience or channel and also share some advanced tips coming up.
              </p>
              <p>
                five <b> specific strategies for building your income on youtube.</b> If you have a small audience and a small channel or
                you're just starting out now you may have heard some of these strategies before but I believe that in this training you're gonna learn some advanced tips and maybe some case studies and some creative ideas that you've never thought of before.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, let's dive into the training right now, to get these tips but let's get a strategy number two which is revenue you know we talked about how to grow your audience that first step is gonna help you do that there's gonna help you <b> grow your income </b> and we wanted to specifically go through
                <b class="text-warning"> five ways to earn $500 plus with youtube. </b>Now you've heard maybe some of these before maybe you haven't but we have some good case studies and illustrations and we're gonna be talking about.

      <div class="brand-three">
        <div class="container">
          <div class="brand-two-img text-center">
              <img src="img/earn-with-youtube/youtube-ads.JPG" alt="make money with youtube ads" title="make money with youtube ads" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
         <h2>1) YOUTUBE ADS: MAKE MONEY FROM YOUTUBE :</h2>
         <p>you tube give you some actionable stuff and so if you're saying you know how to make this sustainable because you know we need money to fund the mission and you should never be ashamed of that right if you want to turn your creativity into a career you have to figure out how to monetize and one of the ways to do that.
        </p>
        <p>Is with youtube ads the problem is right now and this is mostly in the US so even international this is typically a little bit lower is that <b class="text-warning"> you get usually two dollars per thousand video views </b> and that's called a CPM. So, <b class="text-warning">if your goal was to get five hundred dollars on youtube.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          You would need a quarter-million views and if you wanted to get five hundred dollars like a month you would need to
          at least get at least that many views now see CPM's vary and there are lots of variables but just gives you some basic
          math and so, for instance, one of the youtube videos that I  got two hundred twenty-two thousand views now will tell you
          about this tool a little bit later but vid IQ will give you estimated earnings of anybody's video including other people's  channels.
        </p>
        <p>That's not really super accurate because our CPM is more like five dollars so that video is made between four hundred,
          six hundred dollars but the key strategy if you want to figure out how to build your income with <b class="text-warning">YouTube ads</b>  is you just need a lot, a lot, a lot of views and so that is actually why this is our least favorite way of <i>making money on YouTube</i> we have to share it, it could be helpful could be a bonus but we want to dive into some better strategies and so. 
        </p>

          <div class="brand-two-img text-center">
              <img src="img/earn-with-youtube/affiliate-program.jpg" title="make money from affiliate program" alt="make money from affiliate program" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
         <h2>2) AFFILIATE MARKETING: MAKE MONEY FROM YOUTUBE :</h2>
         <p>The second one is <i class="text-warning"> affiliate marketing </i>this is basically what affiliate marketing is you sign up for an affiliate program just like say Amazon Associates and then you can get a custom link that you put in your you tube description and then when visitors click on that link <i class="text-warning">you can make money.</i> 
        </p>
        <p>It's as simple as that so if you recommend a beauty product or technology or a pet product or clothing. I mean anything if there is something that exists in the world. There's probably an affiliate program for it and so this is Jabin and he's got a barbecue channel and so here's a good example right you type in barbecue accessories and he has this ranked video that he is doing affiliate marketing on and I just caught up with Jabin you know he puts out a video like this talks to his favorite barbecue accessories to the affiliate marketing. 
        </p>
        <p>
         So this was 12-month results for him but mind you from scratch basically his channel is about a years-old  so so far. he's in Canada he's done 500 dollars a little  bit on Amazon he's done a hundred dollars on other affiliate programs and we and then he's done Adsense so that's not bad - right we talked about YouTube ads 840 - and he's also got a few thousand dollars in free products now, of course,  we have to say on this master class that these results or anything else any other results we share you know the results is not typical.
        </p>
        <p>
            They take hard work in action and then we use them for illustrative purposes, not a promise of what you can earn
            because the reality is sometimes people take in for me you have to take action to get the results and here's a power tip and this is for affiliate marketing general Amazon actually just added a new one link feature so you can start mount monetizing multiple different countries through one link there are a few other services that do this as well and so.            
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a progression that's really big in <b> affiliate marketing </b>right now you know because you have an international
            audience especially on YouTube and so look into one link if you're already doing Amazon and look into expanding into basically smart links which helps you it what it does is it decides what store like people are coming from and
            then it just takes them to the correct store internationally and it's not just Amazon that's doing this so.
          </p>

            </div>
         <h2>3) CROWDFUNDING: MAKE MONEY FROM YOUTUBE :</h2>
         <p>let's dive into number three as far as a <i class="text-warning">practical way of generating five-hundred-dollar </i>  a month and when is crowdfunding now you probably heard about this before it's like patron and a great example if somebody was a part of our advanced training and the private group is Justin Koh. With that Christian blogger and so he's been building up his channel and he launched a <i> patron  </i>and he has over 57 people supporting him now. <b class="test-warning"> This doesn't happen overnight </b> and I think that's the key here to always lead with value first.
        </p>
        <p>He built up his authority built up you know trust he added tons of value to people but then eventually he was able
        to surpass even that five hundred-dollar mark as a base of just support so that you know again money could fuel his the
        mission which is you know based on his faith and really changing people's lives and making a difference in the world and so <b class="text-warning"> crowdfunding </b>is a great way.             
        </p>

         <h2>4) MERCHANT PRODUCTS: MAKE MONEY FROM YOUTUBE :</h2>
         <p>Another way is <b class="text-warning"> merchant products you can make money from this </b>and so I asked in our group recently, I said hey what are some of the products you guys have one person's got a journal on Amazon. Justin has his own shirts that Christian blogger right, So he's got his own t-shirts, Jabin from the barbecue he has his own barbecue rub. So you know have you ever thought about creating merch or products around your niche or your brand Tim has oil paintings and he does custom oil paintings and watercolor paints for people on his channel and people who connect with him on YouTube.
        </p>
        <p>
            So this could be t-shirts, accessories, digital products, art creates creative stuff music selling songs on iTunes or
            anywhere, coaching freelance services so many different ways to do merch and to do product one cool site for this is merged amazon.com and so there's a lot of different ones the spring but this is kind of a hot new one before all you got to do is upload your artwork set your price they print it they ship it and you get the royalties and so something
            simple like this to build your income This is also one of the best ways to <b> make money online.</b>

         <h2>5)BRAND DEALS: MAKE MONEY FROM YOUTUBE :</h2>
         <p>The last one is <b class="text-warning">brand deals you can make money from this</b> and this is like creating videos for companies and brands in exchange for the proof and you know one myth is that you have to have a huge audience for this stuff to happen but here's a great example from Heather but she also is a new YouTuber pretty brand new has not been doing YouTube for very long and she's doing the homeschooling Miche now a while ago because before she's even where he was today these results are from a while ago in just eight months.            
        </p>
        <p>
        she grew twenty-five hundred subscribers eighty-five thousand channel views and only fifteen
        videos so not bad but did catch this it's not very big right still kind of relatively small a little bit of monthly income with YouTube and affiliate but she got a brand deal with a home school curriculum company that first they comped the product that she and her family would have had to pay for anyways right because they do that every year expensive curriculum so she gets eleven hundred dollars in free product plus <b> thirty-six hundred dollars to do a brand deal.</b>            
        </p>
        <P>
            Reviewing that product and sharing it with their audience as they go through it and then she also gets 10%
           <i> affiliate Commission's </i>on top of putting that out there simply because of doing you know a brand deal and the question
            is do big only big channels get this and so the answer is no right Forbes eighty-two percent of people are likely
            to follow a micro-influencers recommendation.
        </P>
        <P>
            What's proves you don't need to rely on huge mega influencers to advocate for your brand so there's like a revolution
            right now of micro-influencers which to define that simply it means like <b> YouTube's with small channels </b>or small Instagrams and here's the power tip is you <i> YouTube income stacking </i>what we always recommend is not that you do just one of these but that you stack them all so when you stack YouTube ads affiliate marketing crowdfunding your own merchant products your own brand deals and actually many more income strategies like that even little amounts in each category is how you could begin to transition faster to go part-time you know side income or even full-time.
