        <h1 class="text-uppercase">Top 3 Best Books To Start Your Own Business </h1>
        <p>In this ARTICLE, we'll be talking about best books to read, if you wanna start business, more
            specifically if you wanna start a successful online business, but, won't be what you think it is.</p>

                <p>One thing right off the bat, you hear me talking a lot about reading books and
                    you know you hear a lot of other people talk about books and of the importance
                    of books, 100% agree with that, because books are really, really good for
                    mindset. Okay, reading certain books, and I'm gonna talk about three really
                    important books for mindset, reading certain books can really help you get your
                    mind on the right track and kinda, inspire you to get out there into the world
                    and do great things.</p>

              <p>Now, however, mindset is not everything, you gotta
                understand that. Okay, mindset is not everything. There are so many people out
                there with a great theoretical mindset, making zero money. And that shouldn't be
                you, which is why I wanted to make this ARTICLE, because books are very bad
                for one thing, and that is, execution.</p>   
                
                <p>Books are unfortunately very bad for
                    execution, why is that? Well, a book doesn't have any accountability for it, not
                    really, a book can you know, give you exercises, and kind a maybe tell you, "You
                    gotta do this exercise "before you read the next chapter," et cetera but, come
                    on, you and I both know, whenever we stumble across stuff like that, when have
                    you really done it? You know, whenever we really, when the book said, "Take this
                    book down now and do the exercise, "and then return to chapter four," we're like
                    that, "I'll do it later, "let me just keep reading right now, "I'm so nicely in
                    the flow."</p>


                    <p>Nobody does that, cause book can't reach out to you and call you and
                        message you on a daily basis saying "Hey, what's up? "Where's, 
                        that exercise? "What's going on?" Right, a book can't keep you accountable,
                        unfortunately. That's not how things work. Right, and on top of that, a book is
                        a very rigid structure, right. Any system that the book gives you can only be
                        customized to your situation so much, you know. It can never be 100% customized.
                        It can never listen to your feedback. It can never listen to your questions. </p>

            <p>A book is again, it's a great thing for mindset, but mindset is not everything.
                Something that will actually help you much more to actually get you tangible
                results is a mentor. you've heard me saying this over and over again,
                there's nothing new, because a mentor equals mindset plus execution plus
                accountability.  because a mindset can teach, a mentor can teach your
                mindset just as well as the book, but at the same time a mentor can customize
                the strategy to you, can answer your questions, can give you feedback, can keep
                you accountable, can call you, can phone you, can message you, et cetera. Right,
                you've heard me talk about this before now, books are still great, absolutely.
                In an ideal world, you read a bunch of books, while at the same time you have a
                mentor, all right. We'll get to that in a second. Here's my favorite books. I'm
                gonna give you, obviously, I have more favorite books, and I read a lot of
                books, I read around a book a week. Here's the thing, I'm gonna give you four
                really great books when it comes to mindset, as promised.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">1) Total Recall by(Arnold Schwarzenegger):</h2>
            <p>Number one, Total Recall by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Why is that so important, not only for me as a
                fellow Austrian? Right, I come from a 5,000 people cow town, which is kinda
                crazy every time I get back to that cow town. You know people will look in and
                you know my old friends are like, "Wow, what have you been doing? "We're seeing
                on your Instagram," and stuff like that's very fascinating. And a person who
                really helped me a lot with getting out of there, out of this like small world
                mentality that growing up in a village kinda gives you, is Arnold Schwarzenegger
                with his book Total Recall. Get the audio book. I'm a big believer in
                audiobooks, more about that later because he reads the first and the last
                chapter himself. And, it's really great because look, the book really helps you
                connect the dots between somebody who's just a simple Austrian dude with a huge
                dream, sets out into the world and accomplishes that dream. </p>

             <P>And then that person has another huge dream and accomplishes that as well, and so on and so forth. Arnold Schwarzenegger had so many ridiculously crazy dreams that nobody believed
                he could do, and he achieved them all. He went to become a pro-bodybuilder in a
                world where there was no body building yet, where he couldn't even have access to
                the gym in his little home village, and then he became a pro-bodybuilder and he
                wanted to become Mr. Universe. He became Mr. Universe and he began wanted to
                become again Mr. Universe. I think he became, what six times Mr. Universe, then
                he wanted to move to America to become a famous actor. Everybody told him it's
                not possible. He became a world famous actor on the best at, best paid actors in
                the world. Then he said, yeah, if he wanted to be rich, he was to be a
                businessman. Everybody told him you couldn't do that then he became a
                businessman, made his first million with real estate. Then he said he wants to
                become a politician. Everybody said it's not possible to become a politician,
                the governor of California. That's an amazing feat. That's one of the most
                amazing, unbelievable life stories that you could ever read.</P>

                <p>And whenever you're sitting there, building on your, building your business and you maybe feel lost, you may feel like you can't reach it, grab that book, turn on that audio book,
                    read two pages. It will, it will reignite that fire within you because again, it
                    connects a simple person with a big character. You can see that big character
                    that someone has become over years of work, also started with just another
                    simple person, just like you and me, made out of flesh, blood and bones. Right,
                    that's again, one of the most amazing books.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">2) Unscripted by ( MJ Demarco):</h2>
            <p>Second book, Unscripted by (MJ Demarco). This is really good because (MJ Demarco) really bashes the
                establishment, nine to five jobs, education, college, et cetera, he's bashing it
                relentlessly in that book. I started reading his first book first, Millionaire
                Fastlane. I'm not even sure if it was his first book, but his previous book,
                Millionaire Fastlane, which I also like, but Unscripted, I like better because
                he's an angrier, more grumpy (MJ Demarco) and he really hammers that into you, how
                stupid nine to five jobs are and how stupidly ridiculous colleges and degrees et
                ceteras, are. So it's perfect if you wanna start a business. </p>

             <P>This this thing, this book will really detoxify you from any sort of mainstream narrative
                thinking. Right, really great book, highly recommend. On top of that, to get
                ready to go a little more specific into business, 80/20 Sales and Marketing by
                Perry Marshall, absolutely amazing book. Teaches you a lot about priorities in
                business and how important certain 20% are that will give you 80% of the
                results.</P>

                <p>This is a principle that I'm, I'm applying in all types of areas in my
                    business and sales, in marketing, in brand building, in communication with my
                    team, etc... Really highly recommend that book.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">3) Can't Hurt Me, by (David Goggins):</h2>
            <p>And last but not least, my most recent favorite Can't Hurt Me, by (David Goggins). Huge on mindset.
                Absolutely fantastic. This is a guy who've, who's done SEAL training, three
                times. He actually went through Hell Week three times. He ran 100 mile marathon
                in 24 hours without any training, without any previous training, with two
                fractured legs, craziest life story ever and whenever I'm sad, and whenever I'm,
                I find myself in a very stressful situation, I blast that book. It really helps
                you when you're in a high pressure situation life right now, you know where
                where that, you think there is no way out, read that book. It inspires you to
                keep going and develop this really incredibly, incredibly strong work ethic.
                These are the four books I can wholeheartedly recommend. </p>

             <P>Now, here's the trick, how I read books. I read audio books. I haven't held a physical book in my hand
                and years I think, because I'm a busy person, and most of us are very busy and
                really finding the time or taking the time, to sit down with the book and in
                silence and read, it, it takes a lot of effort. What is much easier if you have
                audio books on your phone. I use Audible, you can use any other, I'm not getting
                paid by Audible, you can use any, any other app for that. And, you have it on
                your phone, it's always with you. You have headphones with you all the time, put
                in the earbuds, you put on your headphones, whatever it is, you blast an audio
                book. Right and you've heard me saying this before, you're commuting 30 minutes
                a day to work. 30 minutes a day back and 30 minutes a day forth, that's that's
                an hour of audiobook. Now you listen to the audiobook and double
                the speed, you get two hours of reading and without ever having to sit down, you
                get that in just on the side. You're driving in a car, blast an audio book,
                you're walking to the gym, 10, 15 minute walk, blast an audiobook. </P>

                <p>Not a big fan of blasting audiobook in the gym because I really wanna be focused on the
                    exercises and vice versa also on the, on the book, but on the way there and on
                    the way back, all the time. I, but what about listening to music, I deserve
                    listening to music. I prefer listening to one or two really good songs, with all
                    my, with all my attention, after a good work day, than just listening to a bunch
                    of songs, while I walk somewhere where I could actually blast an audio book,
                    okay.</p>

               <p>Same thing goes for when you're cooking, when you're waiting for the bus,
                when you sitting in the, standing in the elevator, blast an audio book. These
                couple minutes, especially if you do it double the speed, they, they stack up,
                over the day, and over the week. You're easy just on the side, read a book a
                week, that's incredible. A book a week, that's over 50 books a year, that's
                incredible.</p> 
                
                <p>Right, here's the important thing though, here's,the last
                  important point that I wanna teach you here. And that is don't get stuck in
                  "just reading". Okay, you need to execute. That's, it's, it's very, very simple.
                  So many people, I meet on events, online, they DM me, they're like "I'm reading
                  all these books, "I've read 400 books," there's literally people out there who
                  read 400 books, "I've read 20 books last year," blah, blah, blah. "I'm still
                  broke, I haven't executed anything, "but I know all these books." And, and, and,
                  this' crazy because, it's almost like they're, they're showing off, on how many
                  books they've, "Have you read this book, "that book by that person?" Yeah, but
                  what, what about the execution? The book itself is a complete waste of your
                  time. If you never learn to execute these things, it's a literal complete waste
                  of your time, if you don't apply those things. Don't get stuck in "just
                  reading", don't become a master of theory because the theory doesn't pay your
                  bills.</p>

                  <p>The theory doesn't allow you to go on vacation with your spouse. The
                    theory doesn't make you free of the establishment of nine to five jobs, the
                    theory doesn't make you break free from the hamster wheel of waking up, of being
                    born, going to school, getting a job that you hate, getting a mediocre family
                    and then dying. A book doesn't help you break free from that, execution at us.
                    Okay, get a mentor, execute the things that the mentor tells you to do, read
                    books on the side, just to titillate your brain, just to be able to execute some
                    of these things even better with the help of the book, and that is it.</p>

                    <p>This ARTICLE right here was a complete waste of your time, just as much, unless you
                      execute those things that you've just learned.</p>
