            <p>One quick disclaimer before we get into these jobs even though it's true
                that you don't need a degree for any of them you do need to study and get in a
                sufficient practice before you'll be able to do them.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">1) Pinterest manager:</h2>
            <p>
                Job number one is a
                Pinterest manager, a Pinterest manager it manages the Pinterest account and
                pinning activities of a business many businesses use Pinterest to market their
                website and their products but they don't want to do all that work themselves
                and so they hire a Pinterest manager to do it for them this is a job that pays
                pretty well most Pinterest managers earn at least $25 an hour although they
                often charge their clients a monthly retainer fee of several hundred or even a
                few thousand dollars to manage the Pinterest account.</p>

                <p>The other great thing about
                    this job is that it doesn't require very much study before you'll be able to do
                    it very well Pinterest marketing is relatively simple so anyone can do it if
                    they learn the necessary skills.</p>

          <div class="doctors-one-content">
            <h2 class="mt-3">2) Content repurposer:</h2>
            <p>
              The second job opportunity is to repurpose
              content for businesses now there isn't really a title for this job because it's
              not very common and different people who do this sort of work call themselves
              different things for the sake of this video let's call it a Content repurpose or
              but basically what this person does is they take content that a business is
              making for the internet such as videos or blog posts and they turn it into other
              kinds of content.</p>

                <p>So, for example I've worked with content repurposes to take my
                  videos and then turn them into written form so that we have articles for my
                  website and also to then take excerpts from those articles that we can share on
                  social media as quotes.</p>

            <P>Sometimes also graphics are designed to go along with the
              blog post that then can be shared on Pinterest in this way the business is able
              to maximize their resources they're able to make one piece of content and appear
              to be everywhere on the Internet the content repurposed sir is doing something
              very valuable for the business and they generally have the business on a
              retainer paying them several hundred or again a few thousand dollars a month.</P>   
              
              <P>This work can be very standardized for the content repurpose er and by that I
                mean that they can create processes that can help them to get the work done a
                lot more quickly but they're still providing this premium service to the
                business so they can earn a pretty high hourly rate.</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">3) YouTube channel manager:</h2>
            <p>
              The third job that I'll
              share with you today is to be a youtube channel manager you probably already
              know what this kind of person does basically they are running a YouTube channel
              for a youtuber YouTube creators have a lot on their plate they have to film
              videos and get those videos edited they also often are talking to brands about
              sponsorships and then continuing that communication with them to come to a good
              agreement they have to create the thumbnails for their videos they have to
              upload those videos and configure the metadata there's just a lot that goes
              getting to running a YouTube channel.</p>

                <p>But most youtube creators want to focus on
                  one aspect of it the creation part they got into YouTube because they love
                  making videos and they don't really want to deal with all the admin side of
                  running their channel and this is where the YouTube channel manager can really
                  come in handy and can provide a valuable service to these youtubers.</p>

            <P>Just like with all the rest of these jobs you don't need a degree to be a YouTube channel
              manager in fact I'm pretty sure you can't even get one but in order to become a
              channel manager what you'll need to do is prove yourself the best way to do this
              is to get as much experience as possible and you can do this by working for free
              with smaller channels to get your feet wet and learn the ropes as you become
              more valuable to these channels you can ask to be paid or you can work on
              finding larger channels that are interested in paying you for your help and this
              way you can work your way up the ladder and increase your pay.</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">4) launch strategist:</h2>
            <p>
              Next up job number
              four is to be a launch strategist many businesses especially online businesses
              regularly market their products with launches or promotions these can be very
              profitable events for the business but they're also a lot of work to run because
              there's a lot of moving parts there might be emails that need to be sent out or
              ads that need to be run and many different aspects of the sale that need to be
              tracked.</p>

                <p>This is where a launch strategist comes into play a lot strategist keeps
                  track of all these different aspects of the sale or the promotion so that the
                  business can make the maximum profit with the least amount of strain on the
                  company itself again a launch strategist doesn't need to have a degree now a
                  background in marketing is certainly helpful here but primarily you need to
                  learn how launches work and you need to get some practice running launches for
                  yourself the more practice you get the more valuable you'll be to a business and
                  the more they will be willing to pay you it's very common though for business to
                  pay a launch strategist several thousand dollars per launch that the launch
                  strategist helps out with though.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">5) specialized graphic designer :</h2>
            <p>
              Job number five is a specialized graphic
              designer now as I mentioned at the beginning of this video there are many
              graphic designers out there so there's a lot of competition in this field
              however there are some specialized type of graphic design but not very many
              graphic designers provide but the businesses who need these types of graphic
              design are willing to pay premium rates for them.</p>

                <p>For example I'm talking about
                  things like having PDFs designed for digital products many online businesses
                  need these digital assets created and and use them to either market their
                  products or as a component of the product themselves because these assets are
                  either being used to market the product or as part of the product themselves
                  they're much more valuable to the business than say social media graphics are
                  and because of this the businesses are willing to pay much higher rates.</p>

                  <P>The key
                    here is that if you're a graphic designer and you want to get into this kind of
                    work you have to brand your specializing in this type of work if you want to be
                    able to attract the clients who are looking for this type of design work and you
                    want to be able to charge the highest rates. </P>

                  hand if you are a facebook marketing strategist or a facebook advertising
                  strategist and you focus on paid advertising on facebook then you're going to
                  help businesses come up with strategies for their advertising campaigns on the
