            <h2 class="mt-3">1) Co-working space:</h2>
            <p>
              First business idea is starting a co-working space and I know if you live in a big city like San
              Francisco Los Angeles there are plenty of co-working spaces but I also find that
              when I travel to smaller cities I struggle to find the right place to work out
              of Starbucks yes a pretty common place to work from like a lot of people bring
              their laptops but I just don't like this barista coffee machine sound it
              distracts you from anything you do I don't like people walking around all the
              time sometimes maybes come in and start crying you know there are so many
              factors that just distract you and I wouldn't mind paying what I paid to
              Starbucks and like coffee fees to a small co-working space.</p>

             <P>what I've seen in other countries what people do they rent an apartment and convert it into
              co-working space just for friends and they come and work out of there of course
              if your landlord allows that but people all over the world are looking for
              smaller places to work out of and I remember back in st.Petersburg we're
              looking for a smaller office like a hundred square feet office and we couldn't
              find it so in some cities there's definitely a problem with finding the right
              place to work out of and especially because a lot of people are starting to work
              from home and there are so many people who just don't want to stay at home for
              24 hours a day, co-working space is a great opportunity.</P>

          <div class="doctors-one-content">
            <h2 class="mt-3">2) posture corrector:</h2>
            <p>
              The next business idea
              hits 74,000 Google searches last month do you know what it is it posture
              corrector our normal posture these days is this right, this is a normal posture
              and it is not normal for our bodies this is why a lot of people go to cut to see
              chiropractors that's why I have massage weekly because otherwise my shoulders
              are just stuck posture corrector is your business idea so you've probably seen
              them on Facebook you put this small device in your back and it vibrates whenever
              your posture is incorrect.</p>

             <P>I haven't seen a lot of businesses in that space and
              with this trend 74,000 searches a month there is definitely space out there for
              another company and with any market that is just starting to develop I think
              there's always space for like two or three big companies because I remember when
              car sharing business just started to become big there was over and then suddenly
              lyft appeared and I was like wow why would people start another company on this
              market and now lift is huge so it's because you know you can always make
              something a little better you can always make another better offer for your
              customer and this is how you get clients and ever-growing market.</P>

            <p>Business number
              three and here's another piece of data for you apps related to diet and fitness
              account for three point three percent of all apps on the Apple Store what that
              means everybody understands that exercise is important everybody understands
              that the best way to gain muscle strength is to exercise every day but actually
              starting to exercise on any taken day is a huge problem and what I feel is when
              I get new sports clothes when I buy a new fitness course when I download another
              app that's another trigger for me to actually start exercising and I think this
              is why this market has been growing so steadily and if you're a fitness coach
              for example and you have your offline clients I think the first step into going
              to this bigger market of online fitness instruction is to tell your clients like
              hey I was thinking you come to train every day at like 7 p.m. why don't you take
              my online class to exercise every morning as well because this is a great start
              of your day and for it's just $20 a month I would provide you with like monthly
              set of exercises to do at home.</p>

             <P>This is your first step because you don't
              have to rush and create a mobile app right away and then you will think of ways
              to evolve this online thing because again it's growing really fast.</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">4) men's cosmetics:</h2>
            <p>number four
              just listen to the market size three point four billion dollars this is the
              market size for men's cosmetics and there is a niche that has been growing
              really fast one billion-dollar market remember Dollar Shave Club and all that
              stuff 1 billion dollar market shaving cosmetics why because 39% of men in
              India & America all around the world have beards and this is the whole new market you start with razors you
              start with creams and then you go all the way to beard oils two different things
              that you can Tec rate your beard with one billion-dollar market and I think this
              business compared to some others that I've mentioned before it's pretty easy to
              start because if you're already in cosmetics business there's just another
              formula that you would need to create and like another marketing strategy but
              it's always good to be on a growing market it's always great to start before it
              reaches its peak and I still think it's on this growth curve right now so this
              is your office community.</p>

            <p>Business number five and another piece of data failure
              rate for new restaurants can be as high as 90% but what if you love cooking what
              if you like food industry there is a solution for you with 10 to 20 percent
              failure rate which is like almost 9 times lower food truck business you see
              those food trucks outside.</p>

              <P>For example here in  India, US, San Francisco we have those
                streets where every day from I know 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. we have several food
                trucks come over and bring foods from you know different cuisines we have like
                Russian truck we have kimchee or whatever like we have so many things this
                business is pretty easy to start because you don't need to rent a place you
                don't need to hire a lot of people you just turn in the food truck or you buy a
                food truck depending on your financial resources and then you figure out where
                you can go and then every day you can just go to either the same place or
                different places,</P>

                <P>And again because the failure rate is really low I think it's a
                  great way to start your way in the food industry.</P>

            <p>let's jump into the next
              area of the food industry that's healthy fast food if you've ever been to Italy
              and if you've ever traveled by car in Italy you've probably been to there gas
              stations with that prosciutto and mozzarella and arugula salad and those truffle
              oil sandwiches like,</p>

              <P>this is the best place to eat in the whole Italy like those
                car stops are amazing what happens in the US when I travel from San Francisco to
                LA by car I take four boiled eggs celery, hummus, beans because otherwise I would
                be stuck with McDonald's and subway and healthy fast food is such a problem if
                you are outside the big city and,</P>

                <P>I think this is a huge opportunity especially
                  guys if you live between San Francisco and Los Angeles so many people who are
                  worried about their health and who want to eat healthy they struggle so if you
                  go to one of those places where they have all the restaurants and start a
                  healthy fast food I am I would be the first one who would advertise you for free
                  first of all and then please research this opportunity like even airports I
                  don't want an airport they have bread a manchair I don't know what's the right
                  Spelling it but they have this amazing a crab salads they have avocado
                  salad what do you find in a u.s. airport you find a lot of sandwiches you find
                  soups that you don't really want to eat because they don't smell well.</P>

                  <P>So, healthy fast food please let me know when you started please let me know where you
                    started and I will make a story on Instagram about you because let's make
                    India healthy please,</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">7) reusable bags:</h2>
            <p>The next business idea reusable bags and yes huge trend
              right now and I think this is one of the best trends I've seen people tell me on
              Instagram like they DM me marina stop using plastic glasses whenever they see me
              well maybe like a plastic bottle they would DM me and remind me that we have to
              be mindful about our planet and I know that there is a lot that can be done and
              Finland is a great example here they do a lot of recycling in the US I think
              California is is a great example in terms of you cannot get a free back when you
              do your groceries you need to pay at least like 10 cents to get a bag and in a
              lot of shops the bags would be paper bags instead of plastic bags which is
              amazing and with this 10 to 20 cents fee people are encouraged to bring their
              reusable bag and this is actually a huge business opportunity.</p>

              <P>Because you know reusable bags tend to be bulky that it'll be huge and you wouldn't really cure
                them with you but if you make it foldable if you make it stylish so I wouldn't
                need to carry like my standard bag I would just take my reusable bag and put my
                things into it like this would be amazing or a convertible bag this is a huge
                business right now and I see a lot of people doing it and if you're from the US
                look at your local market if you're from another country look at your local
                market as well because I think this market is underdeveloped in a lot of
                countries outside the US.</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">8) smart apparel:</h2>
            <p>The next business smart apparel do you remember that
              was this hoody there was four travelers and I think a lot of people like every
              second person in Silicon Valley had it because we travel so much he had an
              inflatable pillow that was inside that hoody the hood could be converted into
              something that protected your from light it had a charger it had like everything
              you need when you travel and there were thousands of those hoodies sold online
              through platforms like Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, like all of those crowdfunding
              platforms and smart barrel industry is projected to hit four billion dollars by
              2024 and,</p>

              <P>If you're a designer for example and you want to continue in the design
                business but you think that you know just making another sweatshirt or no the
                t-shirt wouldn't be that lucrative probably what I would do I would partner with
                somebody who knows how to create technological stuff like I recently met guys
                who are doing t-shirts that change their color so you don't have to buy like
                five different t-shirts you buy just one and there is this fabric that changes
                its color and there are two people working on it a designer and a guy who knows
                how to create this fabric so finding someone who can bring technology into your
                designer business could be a game-changer because again people are looking for
                smart clothes I would love a sweatshirt that would warm itself up when it's cold
                outside or when it's hot outside to cool itself and I know there are a lot of
                people trying to build something like this.</P>

                <P>so go ahead check out IndieGoGo check
                  out Kickstarter look what people are buying and then find a partner and create
                  something amazing of your own for this market.</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">9) Travel consulting:</h2>
            <p>Let's move on to the last
              business idea and maybe you've been listening to this and you're like maybe not
              okay what you're suggesting is pretty hard to start because yes you need initial
              capital you can need to find a co-founder you need to be good at technology blah
              blah blah okay here's a simple business idea it's a slightly more I thought well
              it's not a slightly Morgan but it's a very competitive market it's travel market
              and we've gone from brick and mortar travel agencies one would go to people and
              talk to them to booking everything online but there's the niche in an online
              booking business that I think needs some improvement.</p>

              <P>What I'm talking about is actually selling rewards
                 tickets what's happening a lot of us I bet you two
                have a credit card that accumulates miles like for every dollar you get like one
                mile and a lot of people don't travel as much like I travel a lot and I use all
                of my miles but also have a friend who has 600,000 miles he would do like a post
                on Facebook every other month saying like I have free upgrades for this in that
                airline do you want to take them and this friend is by the way a GILF and chena
                who was one of my videos he's just giving them away but I also know that some
                people would want to make some income out of it and what you could do you could
                buy miles from those people who just don't use them and sell reward flights to
                people like me who are looking for cheaper business classes so for example I've
                recently bought a flight from San Francisco to Munich for I think it was like a
                hundred eighty thousand miles plus five dollars in taxes I ran out of my miles
                cuz I bought a ticket for myself.</P>

                <P>That was it and even want to fly somewhere else I would need to buy those flights from a
                  travel agent and I have an agency that I work with but I think sometimes they're
                  overpriced and every child to them and I tell them like hey I want to fly from
                  San Francisco to whatever they buy miles from somebody else so they've already
                  bought those miles for say a thousand dollars and they buy a ticket for me with
                  those miles and price let's say $1,500 so $500 is your money for your services
                  and I think it's a great idea I think there's a lot of potential there because a
                  lot of people have those miles but I also feel that there is a ceiling to this
                  business because it's very manual but yeah that's something you can start right
                  away.</P>
