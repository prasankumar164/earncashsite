            <img src="../img/earn-money-tips/managings-online-learning-content.jpg" alt="managing online learning content" title="managing online learning content" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
          <div class="doctors-one-content">
            <h2 class="mt-3">1) managing online learning content:</h2>
            <p>
                Idea number one, is managing online learning content just imagine like
                what I'm seeing right now as a blogger that every blogger who has at least
                10,000 followers starts an online course but the problem for us bloggers is that
                not all of us have a team like I need someone to help me upload the courses to a
                platform and there are so many platforms out there like think if we catch a be
                like all of those web resources I need someone to help me create a landing page
                I need somebody to help me manage customers because some of them have questions
                and you need like templates to reply to them so there's a lot of work involved
                behind the course production and you don't really need specific knowledge to do
                that.</p>

                <p>My personal assistants started helping me doing my YouTube courses and she
                    didn't have any prior knowledge on how to manage or whatever but together we're
                    doing this and we're doing pretty fine we had more than 1,000 students already
                    so just explore what kind of platforms are out there explore,
                    how you can communicate with customers like creating ticket systems, 
                    how you can create landing pages like tilde and stuff and start reaching out bloggers who have
                    their own courses I don't know whether there is a specific name for this online
                    business I would call it producing because ideally you would not only be
                    managing the back end of the course you would also be helping bloggers with
                    promotion and suggesting ideas like oh let's do targeting let's retarget your
                    followers on Instagram or maybe you would be like let's create a special offer
                    let's give 50% off your course for 24 hours and do this massive sale.</p>

             <p>So, ideally I would want somebody like a producer for my courses who would come up with
                ideas and you know share them and be proactive in marketing normally it depends
                on how skillful you are I know something that take 50% of the revenue of the
                course I think it's a little unfair because again content is coming from me and
                it's basically my audience buying but I think somewhere in between like five to
                ten percent depending on your skills depending on what you can offer it's a
                great way to start and then when you have your name you would be able to reach
                to more and more bloggers you would have more names on your clients list then
                you can always raise the percentage that you take from the revenue so this is
                something that's gonna boom in the next five years because they've projected
                that the online learning industry it's gonna grow to 20 billion dollars a year
                and it again I already see people launching courses everywhere I see all the
                bloggers launching courses I see companies who used to teach offline they start
                launching their online courses and we need talent to help us spread our
                knowledge so look into this.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">2) marketing agency:</h2>
            <p>
                The next business idea
                 is a marketing agency and yes I know there are so many marketing agencies out
                 there but the thing is the landscape is changing the way we do ads these days
                 it's completely different you cannot just do like a basic banner and you know
                 because I work with some marketing agencies and they come up to me and they'd be
                 like oh let's make a banner let's say this YouTube course will help you grow a
                 BA and like come on some people know my face already let's do a creative video
                 and I don't want to be the one who tells the marketing agency how to market I
                 want ideas from them and like there are some ideas that performed really well
                 that I came up with like an ad that's a shot with the iPhone like it's very true
                 it's very close to viewer it performs a lot better than the banner and creating
                 viral videos on Facebook like researching what kind of videos go viral and
                 fising your client to do that that is great and then there is of course this
                 technical stuff where you upload everything to face a Facebook I think is the
                 main marketing platform there's a Facebook and YouTube.</p>
                 <p>So, you upload videos on
                    that platform so I would love to work with someone who does research for me who
                    tells me what performs best right now not a year ago because everything changes
                    so fast so again there is so many social media marketing agencies there's so
                    many video marketing agencies but I'm struggling to find the right one and I've
                    worked with several I finally found one but again I still feel that there is
                    room for improvement I don't want to be the person who manages everything and
                    come up with ideas all the time and stuff I want somebody to be there for me so
                    this is another idea how you can start on this idea I would say follow top
                    bloggers and see how they are advertising for example I like how Russell Brunson
                    advertises click Panos I like hi how tylo bus launches something every week and
                    advertises it and his ads get 30 plus million views just follow those people
                    follow somebody who you admire in the marketing space see what they are doing
                    and this is exactly what you need to do because you know just copy whatever they
                    doing this is super easy and then you will generate your own ideas.</p>

          <div class="doctors-one-content">
            <h2 class="mt-3">3) social media agency:</h2>
            <p>
                number three social media agency I think everybody has already understood that you need
                social media for your company whenever I find a website for a company online I
                always go to their Instagram and check what they're doing because if the last post
                that they made was in November 2017 I get back thoughts maybe not everything is
                going well for this company because they don't have money to invest in social
                media (or) maybe I've already shut down and maybe I shouldn't buy product from
                them so now everyone understands that you know having being active on social
                media is crucial creating content that's not just advertising but actually the
                content that's educating your client is super commercial as well.</p>

                <p>companies need that like again for example I'm running this YouTube course but I'm also running
                    another company and I cannot just manage all of the content I would love to have
                    an agency that will come to me and say hey we could write articles about YouTube
                    for you but the thing is I worked with a couple co-operators and they wrote a
                    couple of articles about YouTube but what habits like they are so, generic
                    if we take out the word YouTube and replace it with a ergonomic table it's gonna
                    make sense because again this is very generic and this is not something true
                    entrepreneurs are looking for true entrepreneurs are looking for a social media
                    agency that's gonna dig into their topic and do their research come up with
                    great ideas and great texts and greats and create copy for their social media so
                    again if you're passionate about writing passionate about creating content just
                    take it one level up and I guarantee you people are gonna come to it's it's a
                    slow processing and I'm gonna talk about marketing your early venture but people
                    are gonna come to you and be like business all we've been waiting for.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">4) funnels agency:</h2>
            <p>
                The next idea funnels agency another thing that I was struggling with I wanted to
                create my own funnel and a lot of people use click funnels there are also other
                platforms that you can use.</p>

                <p>I asked a guy to create a funnel he charged me I
                    think it was $350 and it was such a basic funnel that would have taken me like
                    couple hours to create the texts or again really generic replaced I was at
                    promoting my book on how to get admissions to the US University like if you
                    replaced my books name with a cookbooks name would still be the same because
                    his sentences were like you would profit so much from reading this book this is
                    an amazing content I have been gathering for you for fires generic 
                     no advice no nothing and I was so upset and I knew I wasted my
                    money and I did a lot more research to find somebody decent and decent people
                    charged a lot of money and if you come to the market was a slightly lower price
                    if it's a one-person company or two-person company I would say for that you
                    would need to be a pro in the platform where you create funnels yourself you
                    need to be a pro and get response.</p>

                    <p>For example this is a company that helps you
                        automate marketing emails and this is what you need for a funnel and then maybe
                        you hire a copywriter who does text for you and that's it and he can be a
                        contractor so all of the companies that I'm talking about today are very easy to
                        setup if you are passionate about the main subject and the rest like designers
                        copywriters the rest you can find them say a funnels agency is the future.</p>

            <p>
                the last but not the least my camera guy Alec from lost whenever he comes San
                Francisco to shoot me he spends couple days just shooting Golden Gate Bridge he
                wakes up at 4 a.m. goes to Golden Gate Bridge dustiest footage and comes back at
                like 8 a.m. and then we start my shoot and I'm asking why are you doing this
                every single time that you go to San Francisco.</p>

                <p>he's like because these are the
                    best-selling shots that I make Golden Gate Bridge with fog Golden Gate Bridge at
                    dawn Golden Gate Bridge at sunset without fog rainy whatever these have one of
                    the best-selling shots that he has on shutterstock and I think now he's making
                    from 2 to 3 thousand dollars a month just by selling those and you know if
                    you're passionate about creating content create a company where you can first
                    upload your footage to Shutterstock or other platforms where people can buy your
                    product and then you can always work with other contractors with other people
                    because platforms like shutters serving is just about uploading and waiting
                    whatever happens you should also do some marketing on the platform.</p>

                    <p>You should
                        optimize your footage you should try and get into different lists of they're
                        creating so you can drive more traffic and then again if you've mastered that if
                        you know what content performs better in terms of revenue you can always hire
                        more people more photographers and videographers in different parts of the world
                        and tell them like hey I'm gonna pay you somebody from Russia I'm gonna pay like
                        $100 please make this shot off the Red Square in Moscow send it to me and then
                        you just reset on shutterstock.</p>

                        <p>If I were a photographer hope it totally Oh like a videographer would totally do that.
                        </p>
