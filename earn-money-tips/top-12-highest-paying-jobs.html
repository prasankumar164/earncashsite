            <p>So, they're paying a really good money to anyone who can bulletproof their tech the same goes with big pharma companies as well as anything that has to do with intellectual property patents research and development a sophisticated hack could cost the company billions even at an individual level it's never been more important than now to protect your information we've seen worldwide debates about how much info companies like Google and Facebook have on you and how easy it is to manipulate public opinion hackers rely on easy targets especially if you're traveling a lot everything you do online can be monitored and stolen that's why we had to do something about it.
            </p>
            <p>we reached out to the company we personally use Nord VPN and negotiated the best deal for personal cyber security you can get right now you can get three years of internet security at less than the price of one if you go to alux.com/VPN when you sign up with the code LX you even get a month free to test out how easy it is to start using so take your digital security seriously and anomitize your data and location when browsing the internet.</p>
