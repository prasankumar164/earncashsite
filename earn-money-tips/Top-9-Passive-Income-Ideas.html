            <img src="../img/earn-money-tips/START-A-YOUTUBE-CHANNEL.jpg" alt="start a YouTube channel" title="start a YouTube channel" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
          <div class="doctors-one-content">
            <h2 class="mt-3">1) start a YouTube channel:</h2>
            <p>
                The first idea that I'm going to share with you today
                is something that you might already be really familiar with and that is to start
                a YouTube channel so obviously I have this channel here in YouTube and we put
                out videos every single week and across the channel we get about 500,000 views
                per month.</p>

                <p>So, about half a million views per month and that brings in about four
                    thousand dollars just in ad revenue basically once you create your channel you
                    can allow YouTube to run ads on your videos those are the ads that you see
                    before the video starts that make you wait for five seconds or the ads that show
                    up over there in the side column or sometimes down below at the video and if
                    someone clicks on those ads.</p>

                <p>Then the YouTube creator gets half of the money that
                    the business paid to run the ads now like I said my channel gets half a million
                    views a month and we bring in about four thousand dollars because of that
                    however different channels and different niches here in YouTube make different
                    amounts of money per thousand views that the channel gets my channel is making
                    it about eight dollars or so per thousand views but it's more typical to make an
                    average of about five dollars per thousand views and if you make that average
                    amount than you need 200 thousand views per month in order to make one thousand
                    dollars per month from this passive income.</p>    


                 <p>One thing that you might be
                    thinking right now is well it's not really passive because you have to keep
                    making videos every single week in order to keep making that money but the thing
                    is that most of that revenue most of the views we get on the channel actually
                    come from all of the old videos we've created this entire library videos and
                    people will keep on watching those even if I stop making videos here so yes I
                    continue to make video so that I can make more and more money in the future but
                    there is a significant amount of passive income that the YouTube channel
                    generates.</p>

            <img src="../img/earn-money-tips/START-A-MEMBERSHIP-SITE.jpg" alt="start a membership site" title="start a membership site" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
          <div class="doctors-one-content">
            <h2 class="mt-3">2) start a membership site:</h2>
            <p>
                The second way you can earn passive income is with a membership
                website so this is a website that you create that you put some sort of content
                on that in order to access the content people have to subscribe to the website.</p>

            <p>Now oftentimes there's some content that people can access for free to give them
                a taste of what is available but in order to get all the content or to get the
                premium content they need to pay a monthly membership fee.</p> 
                
            <p>Now depending on what your membership site is about and what it offers to its members and how premium
                the content is you'll be able to charge different amounts.</p>  
                
            <p>The cheapest membership sites typically cost about five dollars a month and the most
                expensive ones cost a few hundred dollars a month.</p>  
                
            <p>So, if you were running a
                pretty simple membership site that didn't offer very much to its users then you
                might charge your users 10 dollars per month in which case you would need 100
                users in order to make a thousand dollars or you might have a more premium site
                and charge your members $100 a month in which case you'd only need 10 members in
                order to make a thousand dollars per month.</p>    

             <p>One fantastic thing about a membership site is that does create that recurring revenue a month after month
                and you don't have to necessarily do anything to maintain it now many of the
                best membership sites do continue to add new content every single month but it
                just depends on how you structure your site and whether you create all that
                content in one batch before you launch the site or whether you're choosing to
                create it every single month.</p>

            <p>
                My third passive income idea is to write a book now
                a few months ago I made a video called the best way to make passive income and I
                broke down several different ways that I make passive income and why some of
                them are better than others and why some of them make me more money than others
                and you'll know that a book isn't my favorite way to make passive income but
                that doesn't mean that it's a bad way to make passive income you still can make
                plenty of passive income and writing a book can help you reach plenty of other
                goals as well and help you advance your career now generally when people write
                and publish a book.</p>

                <p>They'll earn royalties of around $5 per copy that is sold so
                    if you did earn average amount of $5 per copy you would need to sell 200 copies
                    of your book per month in order to make $1000 a passive income.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">4) creating a lead generation website:</h2>
            <p>
                Another way that
                you can create passive income is by creating a lead generation website for a
                service business now what exactly does that mean well it means you would work
                with another business that was offering some sort of service or perhaps even a
                premium product to their customers you would create a website of your own that
                is essentially an advertisement for that website it probably offers prospective
                customers some free resource or a free consultation call and you drive traffic
                to that website.</p>

                <p>So, that you can get leads for the company that you're working
                    with and then that company pays you for these leads in order to do this
                    successfully you will need to have a working knowledge of digital marketing so
                    that you know how to drive the right traffic to the website and how to turn that
                    traffic into leads for the company that you're working with depending on the
                    industry the quality of the leads and how much money the product that the
                    company that you're working with sells their product for you'll be able to
                    charge different amounts for the leads.</p>

               <P>On the low end of average if your leads
                are decent quality you could charge it about five dollars per lead and so in
                order to generate one thousand dollars per month of passive income you would
                need to generate 200 leads.</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">5) join the Amazon affiliates program:</h2>
            <p>
                Another way that you can earn passive income every month is with the Amazon affiliates program,
                now I'm sure that you know what amazon.com is and you probably shop on it on a regular basis and
                I can assume that because millions and millions of people do well you can actually get a
                little cut of Amazon's profits if you do a good job recommending their products
                to people who want to buy them.</p>

                <p>Signing up for the Amazon affiliate program is
                    really simple and once you sign up for it you'll be able to share your affiliate
                    links with people who you think might want to buy certain products and for every
                    product that those customers purchase you'll earn somewhere between 4 and
                    8% of the sale price the more products that your prospects buy on
                    Amazon the higher that affiliate Commission.</p>

               <P>Is and even more than that if
                someone clicks on your link but they don't buy the product you recommend right
                then but any time in the next 24 hours they go back to Amazon and they buy
                anything you will still get paid an affiliate Commission for those products
                Even if they were than things that you recommended. </P>

            <p>
                The next way that you could earn passive income is also with Philly marketing but it's using 
                a different strategy instead of making small Commission's on lots of different products that you're
                recommending you choose just one product that is most likely a digital product
                perhaps a course or software that another company is selling and you focus on
                marketing just that one product you might even start a youtube channel on that
                topic start building an email list promoted on Instagram you're actually going
                to be building a community and an audience all based around that one topic so
                that you can sell this one specific product.</p>

                <p>Now with digital products such as
                    software such as courses affiliates typically earn around 50% of the sales price
                    of the product and what that means is that your Commission's can be way higher
                    now if we were to use an average commission rate of perhaps $50 so we're
                    assuming that you're selling a $100 product you are earning $50 you only need to
                    generate 20 sales per month and this can be done relatively easily if you build
                    an audience to some extent or you're running paid traffic into a sales funnel.</p>

               <P>I know that that might sound complicated but it's not that complicated it's
                a relatively easy way to earn about $1,000 or more per month. </P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">7) CREATE A ONLINE COURCE:</h2>
            <p>
                The next way you
                can earn passive income every month is by creating an online course you can take
                this course and either sell it on your own website to which you'd have to drive
                traffic in order to generate sales or you can sell it on a website like udemy
                that provides a platform that kind of comes with built in customers.</p>

                <p>Now when you sell it of course on your own site you can charge much higher prices typically
                    anywhere between about $100 and $5,000 now of course that all depends on where
                    your course is about what value it gives to the students and how well you market
                    it.</p>

               <P>On the other hand if you sell your course on a platform like you to me the
                courses sell for a much lower price typically somewhere between about $10 and
                $100 if you sell it on a site like you me you earn an average of 50% of the
                sales price however different websites have different terms and policies about
                exactly what the Commission's are. </P>    
                
                <P>But if you earn that average of around 50%
                    Commission then you'll be earning of somewhere between $5 and $100 per sale now
                    let's say you were earning $10 per sale which i think is pretty typical if
                    you're selling on one of those sites in that case you would need to generate 100
                    sales per month in order to hit that thousand dollar mark.</P>

                 <P>Now the type of marketing that you need to do for a course on udemy versus a course on your own
                    site is very different on udemy you're basically working on SEO search engine
                    optimization inside of you to me so you need to give away some copies of your
                    course you need to get the reviews on your course you need to get your course to
                    rank well on you to me for a keyword that people are actually looking for.</P>  
                    
                    <P>On the other hand if you're selling a course on your own website like I said you can
                        charge anywhere between around 100 dollars and five thousand dollars and of
                        course you're keeping 100% of it however the big challenge there is just getting
                        traffic onto your website in the first place and that might involve taking more
                        time to build up your audience or paying for advertising or working with joint
                        venture partners.</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">8) INVEST IN REAL ESTATE:</h2>
            <p>
                Another great way to earn passive income is to invest in real
                estate and specifically rental real estate if you want to be generating passive
                income every single month.</p>

                <p>Now I've owned a few rental properties in the past and
                    at least in the area where I live it's pretty typical to earn an average of
                    around two hundred and fifty dollars of profit per unit that you own.</p>

                <P>Now of course there's plenty of things that can throw off that average but if you did
                    make that average amount then you would need to own for rental investment
                    properties in order to be able to make $1,000 a passive income every month.</P>    


                 <P>Now at first glance it might look like any of these other options are better than
                    investing in rental real estate because the risk to reward ratio is a bit skewed
                    compared to those other opportunities because of course there are risks
                    associated with investing in real estate and if you're only making 250 dollars
                    per month then you might wonder it's really worth it.</P>   

                  <P>Fortunately though you are getting some bonus benefits such as building equity in a property that might be
                    appreciating in value at the same time.</P>

            <p>
                The final option that I'll share with you
                in this ARTICLE for making passive income is renting out a room in your house you
                can do this on a website like Airbnb amongst others and when you do this you can
                rent your room out for anywhere between about $25 a night and $200 per night
                depending on the location where you live.</p>

                <P>If you rented a room out for an average of say $50 a night then you would need to rent it out for 20 nights of the month
                    in order to make that thousand dollars. </P>

                <P>So, yes you would need to have your room
                    rented for most of the month if it was only going for $50 a night and you wanted
                    to earn a thousand dollars but this is still a good opportunity if you happen to
                    have some extra space in your house that you're not using or that you don't need.</P>
