            <h2 class="mt-3">1) sales funnel manager:</h2>
            <p>
                Job number one, sales funnel manager this is something
                we've started doing this year but we should have started doing it a lot earlier
                what is the sales funnel,</p>

                <p>So, for example you're scrolling through Facebook and
                    then you see like hey here's a free checklist how to make money online in 2020
                    and you're signing up you're giving them your email they send you this free
                    checklist and then they tell you like hey if you want to do this job like these
                    are five steps to becoming a professional in it and they educate you through
                    emails and then maybe in three or four days they have an offer for you and
                    they're offering course for like two hundred dollars and you don't buy it and
                    then in two days they follow you up with an email offering you a discount this
                    is a sales funnel and I think this is the present and the future of marketing.</p>

            <p>People are especially if it's some high-tech product you won't just click on the
                first ad and buy you need to be educated and this is what sales funnel is about
                so for example I have a sales funnel for my youtube course so you scroll through
                Facebook you see an ad like hey that's a free webinar how to start in YouTube
                and I give ten steps to start in YouTube and then there is an email follow-up
                and then it's on my course same for lingo trip we have a lot of online courses
                that will market just like that giving value first establishing yourself as a
                professional.</p>        

                <p>But you see what happens I need people to do those sales funnels we
                    need somebody who will know how to create a nod of eben AR or just a webinar in
                    general we need people to write those emails we need people to automate the
                    whole sales funnel because the whole thing about the sales funnel so you don't
                    do that every single time you just launch it and it works and works and works
                    this profession is called sales funnel manager and the amazing thing about this
                    profession is that you don't need to be a specialist in many areas because there
                    is a lot of software already on the market they can just use to create
                    everything.</p>

               <p>For example, get response we've been using this company across all of
                our products because you can automate all the emails you can automate all the
                webinars so basically the way it works you go to get response you have this auto
                final section you start with me creative stuff for your ads for your Facebook
                like banners then you go into the next page landing page which you can also do
                and get response you do all the designer stuff they have all the templates for
                different industries then you decide what you're gonna lead people to is ative a
                Bernard which you can also do and get response is it maybe a free checklist then
                people sign up then you decide what's gonna happen like you draw the whole
                scheme of how email is gonna work after people sign up and then you have the
                whole online store that you can set up and get response you can connect stripe
                which is a payment system you can create all the confirmations that people are
                going to receive and this is all just one software I check to not work people
                are ready to pay up to $40 an hour for sales funnels manager work and note on
                average it would take you around 10 hours to create a sales funnel and yeah here
                you go this is something you can do like Monday to Friday every day two hours a
                day in a week you will be complete with one sales funne.</p> 
                
                
                <p>l I think it's amazing so sign up for free for a get response right now and start mastering your skills
                    maybe you would become a sales funnels manager or maybe you would create your
                    own product and sell it through a sales funnel.</p>

          <div class="doctors-one-content">
            <h2 class="mt-3">2) YouTube channel manager:</h2>
            <p>
                The next online job that is already in high demand and I'm 
                constantly looking for a specialist like that
                it's YouTube channel manager so what does this person do I'm a blogger I've just
                produced a video my editor edited everything but I need to put it on YouTube
                what does it mean I need to coordinate with my thumbnail designer what we're
                going to put on the thumbnail I need to come up with the title I need to come up
                with description put all the hashtags in put everything and just make sure that
                the video goes live on a certain date if it's a sponsored video include all the
                links work with my sales manager like there are so many coordination stuff
                around that plus it's also a very creative job because you need to come up with
                titles that people are gonna click so if you love watching YouTube if you know
                what you're clicking on if you know what attracts people's attention you can
                totally try it.</p>

                <p>In terms of pay what I found an up work again it's around $25 an
                    hour I would say Britt video if you're also working with an editor like saying
                    like hey when you cut out this we need to make this more dynamic and stuff I
                    would say would take three to four hours to work one video if it's a vlog if
                    it's like a video like this like a talking hat I would say maybe a little less I
                    pay on average from fifty to a hundred dollars per video and again yeah
                    constantly looking for people like that because yeah you need to be very
                    responsible like you need to be careful with all the titles all the thumbnails
                    you have to be very attentive to details and at the same time you need to feel
                    the dynamic of the video.</p>

            <p>If you want to go to the next step of this profession
                there's the whole channel strategy thing if you're seeing that different videos
                are performing better with your client you can tell them like hey let's double
                down on this content let's do this this and that let's collab with those people
                and people are ready to pay a lot more for that I would say this is more like a
                YouTube marketing consultancy business and I would started with like a hundred
                dollars an hour but you need to be a real professional so start with the YouTube
                channel manager YouTube video manager and then progress.</p>    
                
                <p>Again guys this is something I guarantee you is gonna be in high demand because I'm already
                    struggling to find the right people and if I find the right people they end up
                    becoming youtubers so yeah there's definitely a market for that.</p>

              service people and I need a recruiter to do something that can be learned very
              quickly so like coming up with job description creating a test for that
              profession then just putting it on different websites you can help work
              freelance.com or indeed monster like all of the job upsets putting it out there
              finding Facebook groups that are talking about this profession finding courses
              that teach people how to do that particular job and connecting with managers of
              those courses and tell them like,</p>

            <p>
              The last but not the least is again for creative people were
              talking more about creative stuff in this video it's graphic designer and again
              there are some things I would want to recommend for you to start with yes it
              would be great if you do Adobe Photoshop and stuff but there is also crello.com
              there's also canva.com,</p>

             <P>canva.com they're valued over 1 billion started by female founder some somebody I really want to
              interview next for my channel so learning how to work with those programs they
              have all the templates they have everything that you need learning how to work
              with photos and working with photos can be a lot easier if you use programs like
              the SCO if you use prequel if you use Snapseed like everything you can actually
              use on your iPhone.</P>

              <P>The jobs range from 5 to $85 like different smaller projects
                like people are constantly looking for designers to help them with banners to
                help them with thumbnails for YouTube you can find a niche that's going to work
                for you that interests you the most I would say like banners for ads and YouTube
                thumbnails editing photos for Instagram would be a great way to start and again
                you can start reaching out a bloggers and saying like hey I've done this this
                and this here's my work let me just edit one of your latest photos because I
                think it should have performed a lot better and you edit it and you send them
                your work and you say like hey I normally charge five dollars a photo if you
                want to work with me let's do it faster and around you know I'm available from
                this to this time during the day and this is how you start working and canva
                crello.com, SCO, prequel, Adobe Photoshop is a great tool.</P>

                <P>There are many websites that you can look for jobs </P>

                <li>creative market.com,</li>
                <li>design cuts.com,</li>
                <li>Vasil.com,</li>
                <li>99designs.com,</li>
                <li> up work </li>

                <p> and Fiverr is also a great website I think they started
                  with like different jobs but now there are so many creative stuff that you can
                  find over there and yet projects and fibers is what I mentioned from five to
                  eighty five dollars.</p>
