            <p>
             First of those on my list is called rocket fuel it's by
             Gina Whitman and Mark C winters and it says you one essential combination that
             will get you more of what you want from your business I read this book
             relatively recently as my company was starting to grow very dramatically and I
             knew that we needed to make some changes in order to be able to really take it
             to the next level and do.</p>

             <P>So, successfully not just make more money but make more
                    money in a way that was sustainable so that we could continue to grow we needed
                    to create a firm foundation this book is all about hiring someone to be your
                    right-hand man or your right-hand woman to be the person who helps you implement
                    the grand ideas in your mind I read this book I immediately went out and hired
                    such a person and it has changed my business in so many ways I love books that
                    tell you to do something specific and tell you exactly how to do it but you can
                    actually put it into action and get results from it.</P>

            <p>
                    Let's move on and talk about the next book this book is by the same man which is why I am talking about
                    them back to back it's called traction by Gina Whitman also and it's subtitle is
                    get a grip on your business this book is a little dry and tedious but it is so
                    valuable.</p>

             <P>what it is, it is a system for how to successfully run a business how
                    to keep your business organized and running like a well-oiled machine this isn't
                    the first book that I've read on such a topic but it is the best one that I read
                    personally I'm the one who is always having a lot of ideas which can make my
                    business get really messy really quickly but this book helped us sort everything
                    out and get things more streamlined so that we could focus on moving forward
                    instead of just trying to clean up the messes so that I was constantly making.</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">4) Play Bigger (AI Ramadan,Dave Peterson christopher,Kevin Maney):</h2>
            <p>
                    The next book I have here is
                    called play bigger this is one of the most recent books that I read and I
                    thought that it was really interesting it was also a lot more of a fun and
                    enjoyable read than a lot of the books on this stack there are four different
                    people's names on the cover listed as authors however they explained in the book
                    that three of them actually run a marketing agency,</p>

            <p>Then the fourth man listed on the cover is a writer who decided to team up with this marketing
                    agency to capture their strategies on the written page now basically what this
                    book is about is about category and let me explain a little bit about what that
                    means every business is in some sort of category maybe they're in the
                    hospitality industry (or) the technology industry but more likely they're in a
                    much more specific industry than that not just the technology industry but the
                    smartphone industry maybe even smartphones for a particular type of consumer not
                    just hospitality but maybe they're in the hotel industry not just the
                    transportation industry but maybe specifically the category taxis or maybe the
                    category ride-sharing and then in any of those more specific those micro
                    categories there often is what is called category king.</p>   
                    
             <p>So, for example in the category of ride-sharing companies there is a category king and that would be
                    cooler now the basic concept of this book is that if you design your own unique
                    category then you can position yourself as the category king the company that
                    whenever someone thinks of that industry or thinks of that problem that that
                    industry solves they immediately think of your company as the company that they
                    would choose this is the case for companies like Amazon, Airbnb, uber, Apple,
                    Kleenex, Tupperware and KitchenAid when you think of those brands you think of
                    specific products that solve specific problems and basically this book shows you
                    how to define your own category and position your company as the category king.</p>

            <p>
                    Next up is a book that I swore I would never buy okay so maybe I didn't swear I
                    would never buy it but it was the last thing on my list of books that I might
                    buy and read it's this book right here it's called dot-com secrets by Russell
                    Brunson I didn't know anything about russell brunson except that he was always
                    popping up in my feed on facebook with really annoying ads that i really
                    really did not like and he was promoting this book and I thought that it was a
                    total scam and it was very sleazy and that I was definitely not going to buy his
                    free just pay shipping book,</p>

            <p>Fast forward of several months I'm browsing on
                    Amazon looking for a book to read and I see this book on Amazon and I noticed
                    that it has a couple thousand reviews and that is rated really well and this
                    really surprised me because I was expecting it to be a terrible book that was
                    just a marketing friend just for him to maybe make a little bit of money on the
                    shipping and handling and grow his email list in the process.</p>   
                    
             <p>So, I was really curious I read through the reviews and a lot of people said really good things
                    about it obviously I ended up buying it I read it it is really good russell
                    brunson knows a lot about modern digital marketing especially about funnels how
                    to transform traffic into actual sales for your company he also talks a lot
                    about how to actually get the traffic.</p>      
                    
                 
                    <p>So, if you need help with the marketing of
                            your business and you are working on marketing your business online if you're
                            trying to grow your email list you're trying to generate sales with email

            <h2 class="mt-3">6) The personal MBA (Josh Kaufman):</h2>
            <p>
              Alright we are getting towards the end here this is one of the first business and books that I ever read it's
              called the personal MBA mastered the art of business and basically it teaches
              you everything that you would learn if you actually went to business school and
              got your MBA only it cost something like fifteen dollars instead of however much
              getting your MBA would actually cost.</p>

            <p>Now the thing about this book and the thing
              about getting your MBA is it is all head knowledge if you read this book you'll
              know these things but you won't really know how to actually put them in practice
              in the real world and like I said that's exactly what happens when you get your
              MBA also now of course actually getting your MBA does have some big advantages
              when you actually talk out these ideas with other people that helps them to sing
              into your brain better so that you understand them more fully then if you just
              read them over the course of a few days in a book.</p>   
                    
           <p>However this is much more digestible and if you don't want to subject yourself to Business School then
            this can be a good way to get a lot of the benefits at a fraction of the price
            and with a fraction of the time investment.</p>

              Collins it's subtitle is why some companies make the leap and others don't
              basically Jim Collins and his research team did an extensive research project to
              analyze hundreds of different companies and find a few that went from being very
              average companies to significantly outperforming the stock market for a number
              of years and they ended up finding only a handful of companies that met their
              very stringent criteria and in this book they share all of the reasons why they
              had discovered that those companies were able to go from good to great and how
              you can use those same ideas in your own business to help your own business grow
              and become a very successful long lasting business.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">8) he 7 Habits of highly  Effective People (stephen covey):</h2>
            <p>
              I want to share one more book with you this is my my bonus share
              it's not exactly a business book which is why it's not just a list of eight
              books this is these seven Habits of Highly Effective People I'm sure you've
              heard of this book before but maybe you haven't read it if not I highly highly
              recommend the reason that I've tacked it on to the end of this article is because
              even though it is not actually a business book it can really help you
              successfully grow your business.</p>

           
           <p>Because it will show you how to become the
            person that you need to be in order to build a successful business you can't
            build a successful business if you aren't being proactive if you aren't thinking
            long term if you aren't being diligent if you don't have good time management
            skills and this book teaches you how to develop those and many other positive
            character traits that can help you with your business building but also with
            your entire life.
          </p>

          <p>I would highly highly recommend every single one of these books
            in this deck here they are worth your time and they are definitely a worth the
            money if you implement just one thing from each of these books then you will far
            more than recoup your monetary investment in them and I think that you will see
            a lot of positive changes in your life specifically in terms of your business
            growth.</p>
