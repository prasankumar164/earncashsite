            <h2 class="mt-3">1) front-end engineer:</h2>
            <p>
                    Later job number one front-end engineer whenever you see a
                    website whenever you click on an application whatever you see is a user is
                    actually created by a front-end engineer not only this guy cause the design how
                    everything is laid out on the website he also connect everything with a back-end
                    so when you click on a button an action happens whenever you submit a form it
                    actually goes into a database which is in the backend so all of that connecting
                    all of that and presenting you with something that is really good-looking really
                    easy to navigate through really easy to use that's the task of a front-end
                    engineer.</p>

             <P>In terms of salary it's one $105,000 over
                    13,122 openings right now and you would need bachelor's and computer
                    science and engineering to become a front and developer.</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">2) Java developer:</h2>
            <p>
                    The next job is Java developer and Java is used in
                    a lot of applications that we use on desktop on mobile a lot of client based
                    services a lot of websites are powered by Java like their back-end whatever you
                    see is happening when you're looking for a flight or when you're booking a hotel
                    a lot of those algorithms a lot of those programs are actually powered with Java
                    and there is a high demand and this is why it's number two on my top ten in
                    most in-demand jobs for 2020.</p>

             <P>Salary for this job $83,589 over 16,000 job openings currently on the
                    market and again it's bachelor's NIT you get bored with this Bachelor in Haiti
                    right but guys if you have passion for maths if you have passion for physics IT
                    data just throwing out ideas on the and getting you inspired about job
                    opportunities that you might get if you go ahead and followed that path and by
                    the way for many jobs out there yes bachelor's 19 would be ideal but if you're
                    just starting out and you don't have four years to pursue a full degree.</P>

                    <p>You can always take an online course you can always take a course at a local coding
                            school that would connect you to a future employer and normally those courses
                            last maybe like four to five months so you don't have to be super profound to
                            start working in that field you need to have some basics then you start working
                            and then maybe in two years you go back to studying and improve your skills and
                            get a better position.</p>

                    The next job is very similar to data engineer this is called data scientist and I
                    would say the major difference here is the data engineer knows how to start your
                    information well data scientist is more focused on analyzing that information
                    and driving different conclusions like when you have a lot of data one of the
                    researchers that I really liked was conducted by one of the students that I know
                    in in Maryland so he did a research on how air conditioning Florida affected the
                    GDP of the state because people started to work more they started to work like 8
                    hours a day they didn't get so tired that was a very interesting research so and
                    he did it as data scientist so he took all the information analyzed it and he
                    was able to drive different conclusions because you have so many data points you
                    have like when air conditioners got invented many of them were installed every
                    single year how population grew so there are so many data streams and he just
                    needed to analyze them in a way that he can find correlations and drive
                    conclusions.</p>

             <P>Salary is $107,801 over 6,542 openings in
                    bachelors and mathematics statistics computer science or related field would
                    really help and the guy that I was talking about he was actually doing his PhD
                    and if you have a PhD this would really help you in becoming a data scientist
                    because it's more about like diving deep into information and finding those
                    things that seem to correlate.</P>

            <h2 class="mt-3">4) product manager:</h2>
            <p>
                    The next one is my favorite if I
                    hadn't become an entrepreneur I would have become a product manager product
                    manager is like an entrepreneur within a company for example rahultrip we
                    have online courses and we have a product manager for online courses and she
                    basically supervises the whole department because she's responsible for coming
                    up with a product like we need to launch this this in the course this is based
                    on regular surveys that we do with students next thing she does she works with
                    guys who actually create a script for the course then she works with the team
                    who films the course then she works with an editing team and then she comes up
                    with a marketing plan and works together with our social media team and
                    marketing team like for example she tells them that the right way to promote
                    this intermediate to advanced English language course is to focus on advanced
                    book give people some advanced vocabulary and then we're going to integrate this
                    promotion.</p>

             <P>So, basically it's like being an entrepreneur with the difference that
                    you don't have to hire those teams because they're normally within the company
                    so whenever you come to a company and you work as a product manager they tell
                    you that here are some departments that you're gonna be in touch with and you're
                    gonna work with yes sometimes you would need to hire people for your product
                    like customer support or maybe like an internal marketing specialist but mostly
                    it's like coming to a company with the resources ready for you out there you
                    don't need to invest your own money but then you have all the creative power of
                    working on a product launching it to the market maybe shutting it down if it
                    doesn't work or developing site products if it really really works and there are
                    thousands of product schools out there there are thousands of course that you
                    can take online and this is something I'm really excited about as well.</P>  
                    
                    <p>The base area is o$117,000 and 12,000 job openings
                            and if you have bachelor's in business and an MBA you're an ideal candidate.</p>

                    The next job
                    is DevOps engineer and yes there are a lot of jobs in engineering IT that in
                    high demand because guess what everything is moving online what does dev of
                    engineer do.</p>

             <P>DevOps engineers are expected to work with software developers
                    operators of systems production stuff to oversee the release of code engineers
                    are expected to have both soft and hard skills to get rid of traditional
                    barriers existing between software development operation and testing teams.</P>  
                    
                    <p>There also better to flawlessly managed IT infrastructure requires software support so
                            basically if you have an engineering team and the guys are really good coders
                            but they don't know which tools they want to use like for example which payment
                            processor do we use for this exact operation to work with this country and they
                            go to DevOps engineer and DevOps engineer says ok stripe is a good way to
                            process payments for a platform I'm being really basic here but I just want you
                            to understand what this concept means.</p>

                 <p>So, DevOps engineer is the ones who comes
                        with kind of strategic solutions for the engineering team also DevOps engineer
                        will be in charge of backing up the code he would tell guys we need to backup
                        this month or we have a security breach and this is how we solve it and he would
                        basically give tasks to engineers so you really have to be a good leader and you
                        have to be a good specialist in your field.</p>    
                        
                        <p>Salary is a $107,000 and 6,600 job openings and in terms of education

                    The next profession is data engineer there is so much data generated every day generated online and you need
                    somebody to analyze all of this data like take my business rahultrip we have
                    thousands of customers from different countries and they have different patterns
                    of behavior some come from YouTube some come from Instagram some start with a
                    small purchase like they buy our online course and then some of them buy a trip
                    and this ends up in being hundreds of thousands of transactions every year and
                    we need a data engineer who would structure this information in a way that I can
                    understand it because just looking at Google Analytics just looking at different
                    data points in our internal system the tracks everything doesn't make any sense
                    for me and this guy has a really high salary compared to others in our company
                    he takes all the data I tell him which reports I want to see and he presents it
                    in a way so that I can act upon it create a plan part company make decisions
                    based on that data.</p>

                    <p>Salary for data engineers is over a $102,472
                            it currently has 6,900 openings and you need a bachelor's (or)
                            master's degree in computer science engineering or related subject.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">7) software engineer:</h2>
            <p>
                    Know with the next profession I'm going to be super boring
                    but I just have to mention it because yeah it's still in high demand and we're
                    probably being high demand for the next ten years software engineer.</p>

                    <p>But what I'm noticing right now is there is a huge trend that you're a software engineer
                            though the one that would be high paid would need to be more specialized in
                            actually writing a code and creating different algorithms that will work because
                            there are so many apps out there that can do anything for you like you can
                            create a website in a couple of clicks, you can create a survey in a couple of
                            clicks, you can shoot automated email campaigns in a couple of clicks and you
                            don't need a developer for that,</p>

                     <p>So, those basic things are actually automated
                            with software already so in order to be a successful software engineer you need
                            to make sure you can actually you've write something like that app so it's not
                            just you know putting a webpage together it's no longer putting an email
                            together and making it look beautiful with match HTML it's really software
                            engineering.</p> 
                            
                    <p>So, you need to be really interested and really passionate about what
                            you're doing bachelors and software engineering bachelors and mathematics
                            bachelor's and IT whatever is more related and more applicable to the path that
                            you want to choose.</p>   
                            
                     <p>The minimum salary would be over a $105,563 a year 
                            currently over fifty thousand job openings I guess a lot of them
                            are here in Bangalore is great hub,Chennai is great hub, 
                             Silicon Valley Texas is another great hub New York is a great hub
                            where a lot of headquarters and based Seattle is home to Microsoft and Amazon so
                            look at those cities if you're looking for a job as a software engineer. and by
                            the way its projected that the demand for software engineers would increase by
                            twenty one percent in the next nine years so you have a bright future out there
                            guys.</p>

                    position is strategy manager and this is not an entry level of mid-level
                    position. strategy manager is somebody who is able to analyze incoming data
                    analyze different trends in the market and come up with a strategy for a company
                    and if you're a strategy manager you would normally report to the CEO, CEO or

                        something I've used when it was at a university they taught us how to work with
                        big data and you would need to know the current trends in the market you have to
                        be really a market expert so probably you have 10 plus years of experience on

                        just goes out of the blue they have to be realistic because if you set the goals
                        that are too high your employees are gonna be discouraged and they won't be
                        interested in performing well because they would know that the goals are too
                        high.</p>
