     <p class="my-3">
      There are two big picture strategies that you can use to get views on
      YouTube now as soon as I say that you might be thinking wait you've heard a lot
      more strategies than that in the past you've seen plenty of videos about lots of
      ways to get views on YouTube and you're right there are a lot of other ways to
      get views on YouTube.
         </p>
         <p>So, let's jump into the topics,</p>
  </div>
 </div>

      <h2>Top 2 tips to get more views on youtube</h2>
      <h3> 1) Keyword research</h3>
      <h3> 2) Community LEADER</h3>
       <P>There are two main big picture strategies that work
        really well and so that's what I'm going to be getting into in today's ARTICLE
        what each of those strategies are how they work and how to know which one is
        right for you and growing your channel on YouTube.</P>
      </div>

<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>1) Keyword research:</h3>
       <p>The first main strategy is
        called keyword research now this is the strategy that most people talk about the
        most because how to execute this strategy is the most obvious and the easiest
        and it creates the most predictable results but what exactly is keyword research
        and how can it help you get views here on YouTube.</p>

        <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
          <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/14-fabio-rodrigues-iuLMNZkXsSw-unsplash.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Keyword research" title="Keyword research">
         </div>
   
     <P>Basically keywords are specific words or phrases that people may search for so an example of this might
      be the word pet or it might be a phrase like how to decide what pet to get these
      phrases could be very short like DSLR camera or very long like what DSLR camera
      should I buy in 2020 keyword research then as a strategy to get views on YouTube
      involves researching keywords to figure out which keywords are the most popular
      so that you know what topics would be best to make your videos about.</P>

      <P>But then the strategy goes on to include other steps that relate to how to get your
        videos to rank on YouTube for those keywords or suggested based on those
        keywords or to get people to click on them after the video ranks on those
        keywords so as you can see this one big picture strategy keyword research
        involves a lot of other smaller strategies most videos here on YouTube that are
        about,</P>

        <P>how to get views on YouTube are about keyword research related strategies
          like how to decide which keywords are good keywords to go after and how to get
          your videos to rank for those keywords and how to get your videos suggested
          based on those keywords and then once your video is get ranked for those
          keywords how do you get people to click on them so probably most of what you've
          heard 90% of what you've heard in the past about how to get views on YouTube was
          actually related to keyword research.</P>

          <P>Now before I move on and talk about the
            next strategy I just want to be really clear that keyword research does work and
            done well it can produce great results and garner hundreds thousands even
            millions of views on YouTube but it's not the only strategy there is another one
            that can work really well but you might not have heard much about in the past so
            what I'm gonna do now is tell you all about this other strategy and then we're
            gonna get into the pros and cons of each and I'm gonna walk you through how to
            decide which of these strategies is really best for you and your channel right
            now.</P>

<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>2) Community LEADER:</h3>
       <p>The second strategy I call the community leader strategy now it's much less
        obvious how to execute this strategy and it's also a little bit more difficult
        to know how and so for those reasons it's a lot less common for people to talk
        about this strategy and you might not have even heard of it before.</p>
   
        <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
          <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/10-COMMUNITY-LEADER.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="free youtube subscribers bot" title="free youtube subscribers bot">
         </div>


     <P>So, what exactly is the community leader strategy well it's where you as the video
      creator position yourself as the leader of a community aka your viewers now keep
      in mind that positioning yourself as the leader doesn't necessarily mean that
      you're positioning yourself as an expert or an authority just a leader someone
      who is suggesting new ideas and ideas that are going to be trend-setting in your
      videos you present these new ideas and your opinions on popular topics so you're
      not making videos that are about specific keywords that happen to be popular
      right now you're making videos about a generally popular topic and your takes
      and your new ideas and your new inspiration relating to that bigger topic this
      is the strategy used by,</P>
      <li class="text-white text-warning">Matt Dee Avella a leader in the minimalist community,</li>
      <li class="text-white text-warning">Peter McKinnon a leader in the online videography community, and Janelle Eliana,
      </li>
      <li class="text-white text-warning pb-3">leader in the van life community,
      </li>

      <P>And the strategy has worked really well for
        their channels it catapulted each of them to the forefront of YouTube and grew
        their channels by hundreds of thousands if not millions of subscribers in a
        matter of mere months these creators don't just rely on exploiting popular
        keywords rather they chart their own course creating much riskier content and
        rallying their communities.</P>

        <P>All right now that you understand what each of the
          two strategies are let's dive into the pros and cons of each first I'll explain
          the cons of the community leader strategy since that's what we were just talking
          about then I'll get into the cons of the keyword research strategy and then I'll
          get into the pros of each of them.</P>

<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>a)Cons for community leader:
  </h3>
       <p>The first con of the community leader strategy
        is that using this strategy won't create very predictable results because you're
        charting your own course you don't know what you'll find and in this case what
        that means is that you don't really know how well your ideas will resonate with
        people and how interested they'll be in them.</p>
   
     <P>The second con of this strategy is
      that it's much more difficult to know how to execute it and that is because
      unlike with the keyword research strategy you can't duplicate someone else's
      success when you're using the community leader strategy what works for one
      channel won't necessarily work for another and the very nature of the strategy
      demands that the content you make for your channel is different than the content
      that anyone else is making that you have different ideas and different opinions
      on popular topics.
      </P>
      

      <P>But that is not to say that the community leader doesn't have
        some advantage of some pros and some pretty big ones of that but before we can
        get into those let's talk a little bit about some of the cons of the keyword
        research strategy the keyword research strategy definitely has some cons there
        are three that I want to share with you today.</P>

<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>b)Cons for keyword research:</h3>
       <p>The first one is that the keyword
        research strategy really doesn't build community or promote engagement now sure
        you can still do these things even if you are using the keyword research
        strategy to grow your channel there are still other things you can do to turn
        your viewers into more of a community or to get them to engage but if your main
        strategy for getting views is the keyword research strategy or some aspects of
        the keyword research strategy then you're always going to have to do just a
        little bit of extra work in order to create that community and drive that
        engagement.</p>
   
     <P>The second big of this strategy is that it doesn't drive sustainable
      channel growth now what I mean by that is that even though each new video that
      you put out if you do your keyword research well can get a lot of views simply
      by ranking for those keywords or getting suggested based on those keywords over
      time your channel will attract more and more subscribers people who watched
      those videos and then decided to subscribe but they won't necessarily be very
      interested in the future videos you make.
      </P>
      

      <P>They might no longer be interested in
        that specific keyword that originally led them to your channel and beyond that
        because they found your channel just because of a specific keyword they might
        not see you as a leader someone whose opinion they really care about and they
        won't have that compelling reason to keep coming back to your videos and your
        channel over and over again and that leads me right into, </P>

        <p>The third big con of
          using keyword research as your primary strategy for growing your channel and
          that is that this strategy won't naturally position you as a leader in your
          industry or your community now this might be something you don't care about it
          all maybe all you want is to get the views get the subscribers make some money
          from the ads and if so that's fine but if you're trying to build something
          bigger than that if you're trying to use your channel to build your brand online
          or to fuel your business or you're trying to start some sort of movement or you
          just want people to care about what you have to say then keyword research isn't
          really going to help you do any of those things.</p>

          <p>I mean think about some channels
            you might have seen here on YouTube that just make lists video after list video
            there's normally some sort of hosts in these videos walking you through the
            facts but you don't really care about that person at all you might not even know
            who that person is you certainly don't care about their opinion on anything.</p>

            <p>So, as you're trying to decide how to grow your channel and which strategy to use
              you need to think about whether being positioned as a leader in your industry or
              in your community is something that is important to you there are three main
              pros of the community leader strategy that I want to share with you.</p>

     <h3>a)PROS FOR community building:
    </h3>
         <p>Today the first one is perhaps the most obvious it's that this is, The Strad that does the
          best job of building community but along with that is something you might not
          think about and that is that this strategy also promotes engagement the most
          it's the strategy that is going to prompt your viewers to really be engaged with
          your channel so that they click the like button so that they leave comments and
          so that they watch a higher percentage of your videos because they're just so
          engaged with the content.</p>
     
       <P>The second Pro is that this strategy is much more
        likely to create sustainable channel growth that's because first of all
        community these people are involved and they are a part of this so they're not
        going to abandon your channel nearly as easily second of all because leadership
        you're positioning yourself as a leader and so they're really interested in what
        you have to say and they put value in your opinions.
        </P>
        
  
        <P>Third and finally
          because you aren't basing your decisions about what videos to make on popular
          keywords so you're not dependent on those keywords staying popular now yes you
          do need to make sure that you are talking about a topic that will stay popular
          over the long run but you aren't dependent on a particular keyword that is
          popping one month and dying the next.</P>

          <p>The third big Pro of the community
            leader strategy is related to that but a little bit different it's that it
            positions you as a leader in your community now with,</p>

            <p>Pro number two I was
              talking about how this could cause your channel to grow more sustainably over
              time but here for,</p>

              <p>Pro number three I'm just talking about how good that can be
                for you if you're using your channel to build some sort of brand online.</p>

  <div class="seo-content my-3">
     <h3>b)PROS FOR keyword research:
    </h3>
         <p>The keyword research strategy has four main pros the first one is probably the
          biggest it's that the keyword research strategy creates the most predictable
          results if you correctly implement this strategy then you will get views on your
          videos and those views can definitely convert into a subscriber growth with your
          channel.</p>
     
       <P>So, that's something that's really appealing about this strategy if you
        do it right then you'll get the results you're looking for the second Pro of the
        strategy is that it's easier to duplicate you can look at what's where for other
        channels you can look at what keywords are currently popular you can see how
        other channels are making videos on these keywords and you can do exactly the
        same thing on your channel.
        </P>

        <p>Now of course you're probably not going to copy
          everything about the videos nor what you want to but you can copy the important
          elements that are making their videos succeed and along with that comes the,
          </p>

          <p>Third Pro which is that this strategy is a lot easier to execute than the
            community leader strategy there's a lot of information out there about how to
            use keyword research to get views on your channel and there's a lot of people
            out there that you can study their channels and then figure out what to do in
            your channel when you see what's working on theirs.</p>

            <p>finally the fourth Pro of
              using keyword research is that this strategy has the power to get you traction
              as easily as possible you can really use keyword research to harness the power
              of the YouTube algorithm so that your channel can go from zero to successful
              without that much of a gamble and as quickly as possible.</p>

              <p>In order to succeed in getting views on YouTube you do have to make videos about topics that people are
                interested in if you don't talk about things that people are interested in then
                you'll have a really difficult time getting people to watch those videos to get
                their interest in the first place, minimalism, digital photography and then life
                are all currently trending topics that right now there are a lot of people who
                are very interested in them after time these topics will eventually die away and
                people will lose their interest and if you try to make videos at that point then
                you're gonna really struggle to get views here on YouTube.</p>
  
  </div>
  <span class="end"></span>
  </div>
  </div>
  
  
  
  





<div id="main-seo-content">
  <div class="container">
  <div class="seo-content my-3">
  
         <p>Now fortunately it's a
          little bit less likely that you'll be too early I mean think about if Peter had
          started making videos about digital photography and videography 20 years ago and
          the technology was brand-new or 50 years ago when the technology didn't even
          exist yet well I mean technically he couldn't have made his videos then but if
          he could have made his videos they would have been really really fascinating and
          that just tends to be the nature of new innovative ideas or if Janelle Eliana
          and geobella had made van light and minimalism look as sexy as they do those
          trends would probably have caught on a lot sooner,</p>
     
       <P>let's talk about which of these two strategies is right for you right now and most
        likely to give you the best and biggest results possible first of all if your
        channel is new or small and you're just working vieta off the ground I'd really
        recommend the keyword research strategy there's a lot of reasons for this first
        of all it is going to give you the most predictable results if you really master
        this strategy and you execute it correctly your channel will grow it's also just
        much easier to learn this strategy as I mentioned earlier on in the video most
        gurus who tell you how to get views on YouTube are teaching you keyword research
        strategies there's a lot of information out there about how to do this and how
        to do it well it's also a lot easier to get right and a lot less overwhelming
        you'll be faced with a lot fewer difficult decisions because keyword research
        tends to be a very black-and-white thing to do,
        </P>

        <p>you would just look at the
          numbers and the keywords that are more popular are the keywords that you should
          make videos about and you can do additional research to find more information on
          those topics to fill your videos with you don't have to put a whole lot of
          creative thinking into the process and finally I'd really recommend this
          strategy for a small and new channels because it really works with the YouTube
          algorithm in a great way and leverages the power of the algorithm to be able to
          quickly grow your channel in a very predictable way when you make videos about
          keywords that are popular then the algorithm naturally will be recommending
          those videos to large numbers of people because large numbers of people are
          searching for those keywords.</p>

          <p>So, it's a lot more likely that your videos will get out there get some exposure and potentially take off.

<div id="main-seo-content">
  <div class="container">
  <div class="seo-content my-3">
  
         <p>On the other hand here are
          a few situations in which the community leader strategy might work a lot better
          for you first of all if you've already started getting traction with your
          channel but you want to make sure that it grows into something that's really
          sustainable.</p>
     
       <P>The community leader strategy can do that really well because while
        it's more difficult to get initial traction with the community leader strategy
        it's great for building community and promoting engagement and positioning
        yourself as a leader all of which will lead to more of your subscribers
        continuing to watch your videos over and over again unlike with keyword research
        where people might find one of your videos because of a specific keyword but
        then never care about any of the rest of them with the community leader strategy
        it's much more likely that people will be interested in what you have to say in
        future videos,        
        </P>

        <p>Another reason why you might want to lean into the community
          leader strategy is if your channel is growing and you see your subscriber count
          going up but your views aren't keeping pace so if you're getting more and more
          subscribers but your views are staying stagnant or they aren't growing as
          quickly this is a really good indication that you're probably whether you
          realize it or not relying on keyword research strategies and you're attracting
          these subscribers that don't necessarily care about you and your opinions
          long-term and so that's when is really important to pivot into the community
          leader strategy so that you can start to grow your channels more sustainably but
          also so that you can shift the culture that is currently existing into your
          channel into more of a culture of community and less of a culture of people who
          came for a specific purpose.</p>

          <p>finally you may want to use the community leader
            strategy if you're working on building a brand if you want to establish a brand
            online whether it's just to promote your ideas or its to sell products online or
            offline whether they're your own products or someone else's products whatever
            your reason for wanting to build a brand are you'll be able to do it much more
            effectively if you are seen as a leader in the community that will buy from your
            brand or in your industry because that's when people will really care about what
            you have to say they'll care about your opinions and they'll care about your
            recommendations whether those are recommendations to buy a particular product or
            recommendations to take a particular action you can't make change unless you're
            seen as a leader.
          </p>

          <p>I want to be completely honest here and admit that the
            community leader strategy is something that I was only recently really able to
            define and quantify and it's definitely something that I'm still working on aka
            failing at myself it's tough to figure out where exactly you belong who you're
            leading and what a community wants from you it's also just a lot more difficult
            to come up with unique ideas I mean groupthink is always easier and it's also a
            lot scarier and more risky to divert from what everyone else is doing to chart
            my own course to make content that's a little bit different or share my
            controversial opinions and it's extra scary when you have more to lose like I
            shared earlier in the video the keyword research strategy really generally works
            best when you're first starting out trying to get traction with your channel but
            the challenge is that that means that later on you're going to be more pivoting
            into the community leader strategy which is difficult because that is the
            riskier strategy and if you already created some momentum with your channel then
            you're putting more on the line to make that risk your content,</p>

            <p>So, that's why
              this is a difficult decision and something you're gonna have to wait you can
              either take the faster easier road with the keyword research strategy or you can
              take the longer slower less predictable Road with the community leader strategy
              or you can combine the two and do one for a while and then pivot but whatever
              you choose there's going to be difficulty along the way.</p>

              <p>Over the past few years
                I have really mastered using keyword research to get views here on YouTube and
                it's obviously worked my channel has grown really quickly but now I have to step
                into the scary unknown a prioritizing engagement and community and making new
                different content that's potentially unpopular potentially not as popular but
                that's what I need to do in order to create the community that is really
                important and engage with you guys more.</p>

                <p>So, I really hope that you'll stick
                  around for the ride as I mentioned earlier the keyword research strategy
                  definitely does have its merits and especially if your channel is new or small
                  and you're just working to get it off the ground is actually what I would
                  recommend because it is so much easier and so much more predictable.</p>
