     <h1 class="text-center">how I got 60,000 subscribers in my first year</h1>
     <p class="my-3">
        Wow, in just a couple weeks here it is going to be my one year anniversary of
         starting this YouTube channel of course I've had an account on YouTube way
         longer than that and back in the day I made a couple random videos about some
         completely different topics but it was one year ago that I really kicked this
         channel off and I started consistently making videos all about intentional
         living entrepreneurship and success and oh my goodness in this past year my
         channel has grown so much there's been ups and there's been downs but over the
         course of the year <span class="orangecolor">I've attracted about 60,000 subscribers which i think is
         crazy for my first year and I am just so pleased with.</span>
         </p>
         <p>Now of course there's been plenty of channels in the past
              that have done way more than that in their first
            year tons of channels have gotten a hundred thousand (or) five hundred thousand (or)
            even a million of subscribers in their first year but I was never expecting to
            hit this level of success on YouTube ever necessarily and I know that a lot of
            people who I know who have youtube channels had to work for a few years to even
            have just a few thousand subscribers.</p>
            <p>So,<span class="orangecolor"> I really was very surprised when 
                my channel started growing so quickly </span>but I quickly realized that there were a few
                things that I was doing that were contributing to this growth and were causing
                my channel to be so successful.</p>
         <p>So, let's jump into the topic,</p>

<div class="container py-4">
  <p>So, in this Article I'm not at all bragging I don't
      think that I did anything particularly amazing to make my channel get to this
      point but I do think that there are about seven different important things that
      I did that cause my channel to grow so consistently throughout this entire year
      and I'm really excited to share them with you so that you can grow your channel
      more successfully and potentially start attracting subscribers more quickly but
      even if you don't have a youtube channel and you've just been watching my
      journey here in YouTube and you're curious what made my channel grow so quickly
      I'm really excited to share these things with you.
      </p>

      <p>Now like I said there's six different things in this Article that I'm going to be sharing with you and I just want to say before I get into them that they are all very important and they're
          not in any sort of order because I can't say this one is more important than
          that one because I really think that it's having all of these different aspects
          together that allowed my channel to be as successful as it has been so you might
          be doing three or four of them yourself and think oh that should be enough to
          make my channel grow why isn't my channel growing why am I not attracting
          subscribers but I just want to encourage you and let you know that it's really
          important to do all of these things and that's what's gonna get you the results.
          </p>

          <P>Let's jump into the six thing is that you need to
              do two attracts YouTube subscribers more quickly and the six things that I did
              that allowed my channel to grow to 60,000 subscribers in my first year on
              YouTube.</P>

       <h3>1)VIRAL VIDEO IDEAS (TONS OF RESEARCH):</h3>
          
             <P>The first thing is coming up with really good video ideas,
                now of course everyone on YouTube tries to come up with good video ideas but the
                thing that I did differently and that I'd recommend that you do is to research
                the wazoo out of figuring out what ideas to use for your videos <span class="orangecolor">so don't just
                you know wake up one morning and think oh maybe I'll make a video about such </span>and
                such or I feel like talking about such and such today of course you're welcome
                to do that.
                </P>
    
                <P>If you want but if you want the best results if you want to attract
                    the most subscribers and get the most views on your video then <span class="orangecolor">you need to
                    research. </span>you need to look at other channels that are like
                    yours to get inspiration and ideas and especially to see what types of videos
                    what video concepts people are interested in watching this is just plain old
                    market research and figuring out what the demand is,</P>

                    <P>If you make a video about something random that just occurred to you you don't know if people want to
                        watch it but if you see that lots of other people made videos about their trip
                        to Ireland and those videos got lots of views or if lots of other people made
                        brownie recipe videos and those videos got lots of views that tells you
                        something it tells you that people are interested in those topics.
                        </P>

                of hearing but I have to say it because it is so important and that is
                consistency.

                <P><span class="orangecolor">You must be consistent if you want your channel to be successful</span> I'm
                    not saying there's never exceptions to that there's certain layer channels out
                    there where the creator is not consistent with their time or their quality or
                    the types of videos that they put out and they still manage to be successful but
                    that is really just a wild card and it's not the rule.</P>

                       </div>


                    <P>The rule is if you want to grow you have to be 
                        consistent you have to be consistent with<span class="orangecolor"> what type of
                        content you put out there the quality of your content </span> and the frequency of your
                        content so what I mean by that is first off the type of content you can't just
                        put out a video about one thing one week and something different the next week
                        and something different from that the next week and then expect to be able to
                        attract subscribers and retain subscribers and retain a video views and what I
                        mean by that is if this week I make a cooking video then I'll attract people who
                        are interested in cooking videos and then next week I make a travel video or a
                        tech video then none of the people who subscribe because of that first video are
                        going to watch the second video so my views on that video will be really low and
                        my reach on YouTube will really suffer because of that.
                        </P>

                        <P>So, it's important that you are consistent with 
                            what type of videos you put out it's also important that
                            you're consistent with the quality of your videos because<span class="orangecolor"> if you make one
                            amazing video and then some crappy videos then people are gonna stop watching
                            your videos</span> because they don't know what to expect.</P>

                            <P><span class="orangecolor">Then finally you want to put out videos consistently 
                                as far </span>as time goes so once every week or twice
                                every week so that people know what to expect and so that they know to come back
                                to your channel and a regular basis it also really helps to motivate people to
                                subscribe if you just put out a video every once in a while then people might
                                think well it's not even worth subscribing because I don't know when her or his
                                next video is going to come out.</P>

                                <P>But if you can say I put out a new video every
                                    week or two new videos every week then they know that there is a reason for them
                                    to subscribe.</P>

       <h3>3)KNOW YOUR WHO:</h3>
          
             <P><span class="orangecolor">The third thing,</span> is a little bit more big-picture in vague not
                quite so concrete a little bit harder to implement but it is important and that
                is I knew who my subscriber was now,
                </P>

                   </div>
    
                <P>What I mean by that is if you don't know who
                    your subscriber is then <span class="orangecolor">you might choose a topic that your channel is about</span> you
                    might say I have a Cooking Channel (or) I have a text channel but you will then be
                    very confined with what type of videos that you can make and that might be fine
                    for you you know you might be able to just make cooking videos every single week
                    and forever you know I knew that might be totally fine but for a lot of people
                    you might get tired of that type of content and you want to branch out a little
                    bit and so you think okay Fitness kind of relates to cooking so I'll make
                    fitness videos along with my cooking videos and then maybe people don't watch
                    those videos and you're not sure why.</P>

                    <P>But it might be because people loved
                        watching your decadent dessert videos and that's where all your subscribers were
                        coming from so they didn't want to watch your fitness videos that's just an
                        example but I think you see where I'm going with this if instead you focus on
                        who your subscriber is so maybe your subscriber is a female who is into health
                        and fitness then you have a wide range of videos that you can make that will all
                        be interesting and appealing to that type of person so for me <span class="orangecolor">I know that my
                        subscribers are really interested in being successful </span>and that means a lot of
                        different things that means that they want to figure out what success means to
                        them and it means that they want to figure out better strategies in their life
                        so that they can be more effective and be more productive so when you really get
                        to know who your subscriber is then you can make content that will be appealing
                        to them and interesting to them and they will want to watch.

                  and I think people think this is more complicated

                 (search engine optimization), </span>YouTube is a search
                engine and basically what the concept behind this is is people are on YouTube
                they're searching for things they're looking for certain types of videos (or)
                videos about certain types of things and so they search things both in the
                search bar and also they're browsing around YouTube and they're clicking on one
                video and then they're clicking on another so YouTube is recommending similar
                videos to them.

                    about as possible</span> basically you're just trying to make YouTube's job as easy as
                    possible so that means that you put words in the title of your video that aren't
                    necessarily the most artistic appealing words like that's not the point so much
                    but just practical words that tell what your video is about it also means that
                    you actually write a description that's more than one sentence long that
                    includes several different words about what your video is about you put tags
                    that are relevant to your video and a bunch of them and you also name your video
                    file and your thumbnail file also words that are relevant to what your video is

       <h3>6)ATTRACTIVE,EYE-CATCHING THUMBNAILS:</h3>
          
             <P><span class="orangecolor">The sixth, and final thing </span>is very important and I think that a
                lot of people whose channels aren't growing are skipping this and I say that
                because people email me pretty frequently and they say what's wrong with my
                YouTube channel<span class="orangecolor"> I've been consistently uploading all year and I only have a
                hundred subscribers</span> you know what do I need to do differently and I go and look
                at their channel and this is the immediate thing that jumps out to me and
                conversely I don't know if I've ever seen a channel that was doing this right
                that wasn't regularly you know consistently gaining subscribers.
                </P>      

               

                <P><span class="orangecolor">That is simply to have very eye-catching appealing thumbnail images</span> so the thumbnail
                    image in case you don't know is just a little picture that people see before
                    they actually click on your video like the picture people see of your video and
                    then they click on it and they watch it that little picture is so important now
                    the reason is a little deeper than you might think it's not just <span class="orangecolor">because
                    obviously you want people to watch your video so you want that picture to be
                    something people want to watch </span>I mean of course that but it goes deeper than
                    that because whenever YouTube shows your video to people as an option so it
                    shows up in the surge or it shows on the sidebar of the video whenever someone
                    sees the option to watch your video they either choose to watch it or they
                    choose to not watch it and the more likely the more frequently people take the
                    choice to watch your video the more likely YouTube is to recommend your video to
                    other people.
                    </P>    
                    <P>So, in case that was confusing let me just say that a different way
                        let's say that<span class="orangecolor"> YouTube recommends your video to 10 people</span> whether it's because
                        they searched for it or it's over on the sidebar whatever YouTube shows your
                        video to 10 different people and one of them clicks on and watches it okay then
                        basically in YouTube's eyes your video has like a score of 1 so it's not very
                        popular like I'm over generalizing this big time but bear with me.</P>    

                        <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
                            <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/how-i-got-60,000-subscribers-in-one-year.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="youtube THUMBNAILS" title="youtube THUMBNAILS">
                           </div>

                        <P>Conversely if YouTube showed you video to 10 people and 5 people watched 
                            it then it has like a
                            score of 5 ok like I'm making up the term score obviously but in YouTube's eyes
                            this is much better because YouTube's got people to watch your video much more
                            easily which means that YouTube is able to keep people on YouTube much more
                            easily and it's satisfied you customers better.</P>

            <P>So, it is in YouTube's best interest to show your video to more people beis easily converting
                people into viewers so all that to say if you have an awesome thumbnail that
                really compels people to click your video and watch your video then YouTube is
                going to be all about recommending your video to more people <span class="orangecolor">so we live in the
                social media age and sometimes videos go viral on social media</span> where people are
                sharing them and sharing them as sharing them but a lot of the time when a video
                goes viral on YouTube that's not why at all a lot of the time is because it has
                a great thumbnail and it's about an interesting topic you know that's
                interesting to a certain type of person and YouTube figures out okay such and
                such a type of person really wants to watch this video and once YouTube figures
                that out because of SEO and because your thumbnail is awesome so people are
                clicking on it.</P>

                <P>Then YouTube goes crazy and they show it to tons of people who
                    want to watch it and that is when the video goes<span class="orangecolor"> crazy viral.</span>
                </P>

          <P>So, I hope that that all made sense I know some of them were super obvious and simple and then
              others were a little bit more complex but I hope that I was able to explain all
              these different strategies in ways that made sense and I hope that you enjoy
              this video and you found it helpful I know that in this past year in YouTube I
              have learned so much about what worked with my channel and what didn't work or
              what completely didn't matter as far as helping my channel grow so I really just
              wanted to share with you guys these six different things that helped my channel
              grow so much and so consistently throughout this past year <span class="orangecolor">so that you can take
              them and use them in your channel too.</span></P>
