           <p>
            let's get into it exactly how can you get your first 100 YouTube
            subscribers one of the biggest mistakes that I see so many new YouTubers make is
            that they just wait for those first 100 people or those first thousand people to
            find them and they waste a lot of time in the process because you don't have to
            just sit around and wait for the algorithm to happen to work in your favor <span class="orangecolor">you
            can actually do some proactive things to get your channel out there </span>and start
            attracting those subscribers a lot more quickly.</p>

<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>1)GIVE PEOPLE A REASON TO SUBSCRIBE:</h3>
       <p>So, my first tip for you
        guys is<span class="orangecolor"> to get really clear on exactly what your channel is all about </span>so that
        people actually have a reason to subscribe if your channel doesn't have a clear
        focus or a purpose or a value that it's bringing to people then why would they
        subscribe anyway when someone comes and visits your channel it needs to be
        immediately obvious what your channel is all about now this might be a specific
        topic like a YouTube channel about how to have a successful YouTube channel or a
        YouTube channel about crafts or projects there's obviously so many different
        ideas.</p>
   
     <P>But beyond that, your channel might just be an entertainment channel that
      appeals to a certain type of audience but whatever that focus that purpose of
      your channel is it needs to be immediately obvious so that when people find your
      the channel they know<span class="orangecolor"> why they should subscribe </span>
      because if they know why they should
      subscribe and they'll be a lot more likely to do so that means you need to put
      it in the banner image up on your channe<span class="orangecolor">l you also need to make sure that the
      different videos that you're choosing to make all speak to that particular
      audience or focus on that topic </span>and the thumbnails that you choose really appeal
      to that audience everything that goes into your channel's branding really needs
      to work together to give that message to potential subscribers so that they
      Click that subscribe button.</P>
</div>
<span class="end"></span>

<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>2)Attract new subscribers with SEARCHABLE content:</h3>
       <p>So,
        <span class="orangecolor">My second tip</span> for you is that when you are first starting
        out especially it's really important that you focus on creating what is called
        searchable content for your channel so that means that we're not gonna make just
        daily vlog this winter first starting out because that kind of content is great
        for people who are already subscribed to your channel people who already know
        you and love you and want to see more content from you but<span class="orangecolor">when you don't have
        very many subscribers yet that content probably isn't going to really attract
        new people</span>  in because they're not going to be looking for it and they don't know
        you yet.</p>
   
     <P>So, instead, you want to make content that is more focused on being
      helpful (or) <span class="orangecolor">content that relates to popular trends by doing this</span> you'll be able
      to appeal to new subscribers and help people find your channel people use the
      YouTube search function to search for how to do something and then if your video
      pops up then they're a lot more likely to be able to find you and to actually
      subscribe.</P>

      <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
        <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/earn-five.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Attract new subscribers with SEARCHABLE content" title="Attract new subscribers with SEARCHABLE content">
       </div>  

        <p>When you're trying to decide what to make those first few videos about
        you want to look for search terms things that people are looking for that have
        high search volume and low competition.</p>
        <p>So, all that means is first you need to do
        some keyword research which just means that you're gonna look for what keywords
        people are actually looking for and how many people are looking for those
        keywords so you can use a free keyword research tool like Google Adwords or
        keywords everywhere or tube buddy and I'll put links to all of those different
        tools down below they all can help you do basically the same thing which is you
        can type in a search keyword so something that you think people might be looking
        for and then you can find out what the search volume is which just means how
        many people are actually searching that keyword every single month.</p>
        <p>So, of course,<span class="orangecolor"> you want to look for popular keywords </span>you know keywords that people are actually
          looking for but when you're just starting out it's good to not go for the mega
          popular keywords the keywords that have hundreds of thousands of searches every
          the single month just because those are probably going to be way too competitive
          anyway so it's better to shoot for some smaller easier to hit keywords that
          there won't be quite so much competition for after you find some keywords that
          you're interested in making videos about and have a decent search volume than
          you can actually search those keywords on YouTube and see what videos show up so
          that you can choose the keywords that don't have too much competition you want
          to look for keywords that people are searching for a specific phrase but then
          when they search for that phrase or when you search for that phrase the videos
          that show up in the search results there aren't very many videos that perfectly
          match that phrase.</p>
        <p>So, for example,<span class="orangecolor"> with this video idea how to get your first 100
        YouTube subscribers</span> if I searched that on YouTube and I thought that there was
        only a couple videos that were actually called how to get your first 100 YouTube
        subscribers and most of the other search results that came up were like how to
        start a YouTube channel or how to grow your Instagram account or something like
        that that was related but not exactly what people were looking for and I would
        know that that was a really good opportunity because there's a lot of people
        looking for that keyword and searching that but there's not very much
        competition with videos that are perfectly in alignment with what people are
        looking for in that keyword.</p>
        <p>Now as your channel grows it's great to get away
        from this search-driven  traffic because<span class="orangecolor"> people will get to know you and fall in
        love with you </span>and your audience will start to grow more organically and the
        legacy content that pertains to you and your life or things like that and that
        will give them a reason to watch every single video and not just this more
        utilitarian content.</p>
        <p>But when you're first starting out focusing on creating this
        searchable content will really help your channel to get off the ground and find
        your initial subscribers.</p>

           <h3>3) PROMOTE YOUR CHANNEL:</h3>
               <p><span class="orangecolor">My third tip</span> is do not just rely on the YouTube
                algorithm actually go out there and promote your channel sometimes people say
                things like YouTube doesn't like new creators (or)<span class="orangecolor"> YouTube doesn't help new
                creators enough</span> but really I mean YouTube is doing as much as it can and they're
                trying to serve the people who are watching the video because those are really
                YouTube's customers and there's just so many new channels springing up all the
                time that there's no way that YouTube can really help all of them it's a
                competitive space.</p>
           
             <P>So, if you really want your channel to do well and to get off
                the ground and to start growing then <span class="orangecolor">you need to take some responsibility for
                your own success</span> and do everything that you can to actually promote your channel
                yourself.</P>
                <p>So, I have a couple of different suggestions for how you can do this,</p>

                <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
                  <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/21-PROMOTE-YOUR-CHANNEL.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="PROMOTE YOUR youtube CHANNEL" title="PROMOTE YOUR youtube CHANNEL">
                 </div>  
                
               <p class="text-warning">a) Share your journey on social media:</p>

               <P>The first one is to<span class="orangecolor"> share your 
                 journey of starting your YouTube channel on social
                media</span> So, when you're first starting out you might not have that much credibility
                and you don't have a big following yet right but you have at least a little bit
                of a presence on probably a few different social media platforms like you have a
                few hundred friends on Facebook maybe a couple hundred followers on Instagram so
                just share those people what you're up to tell them you're starting your new
                YouTube channel share with them when you post your first video when you make a
                new banner for your channel whatever is they will appreciate being involved in
                the process and seeing the behind the scenes and that will inspire them to come
                check out what you're doing.</P>

                <P>If you just wait until you make your first video or
                you make your tenth video and you say go watch my new video it just came out
                that's not gonna really have as much momentum behind it as if you're sharing the
                journey with them. </P>

                <p class="text-warning">b) Tell your real life friends and family:</p>

                <P><span class="orangecolor">The second way</span> you can promote your own channel is maybe a
                little bit more uncomfortable but I think that this is really important both for
                you yourself as a person but also for growing your channel of course and that is
                to actually tell your friends and family about your channel and ask them to go
                check it out now of course that might feel uncomfortable.</P>

                <P>But by doing that you're gonna<span class="orangecolor"> take more ownership of your channel</span>
                 and take it a little bit more
                seriously you're gonna know that you need to make good quality content because
                people who you know in real life are actually going to be checking it out but
                those people are also going to be some of the most likely people to subscribe
                when you're first starting out.</P>

                <P>Because they know you and they love you and they
                care about you and so they'll want to do it just for you even if they don't care
                about your channel that much which is okay because getting those first 100
                subscribers like I said is the very most important and the very most difficult
                and so you need to do whatever you can to get past that threshold.</P>

                <p class="text-warning">c) Tell your real life friends and family:</p>

                <P><span class="orangecolor">My third tip</span> for promoting
                   your own channel is to network in online groups So <span class="orangecolor"> you can join
                different groups on Facebook </span>and get it out other people who are in your same
                industry and/or starting their own YouTube channel I wouldn't recommend doing
                the whole sub4sub thing because those people won't care about your channel at
                all and they also don't about you so it's really gonna kind of water down your
                audience and then YouTube will think that people don't even like your videos
                because those people probably won't watch your videos.</P>

                <P>So, one recommend that but you can network and build connections and build relationships and then you'll
                have people who you can tell about your journey on YouTube and about your videos
                and there'll be people who will actually care because they're people who are
                interested in your industry.</P>

           <h3>4)Take advantage of your channels launch:</h3>
               <p><span class="orangecolor">The fourth way</span> that you can promote your
                own channel is to take advantage of your channels launch so this is kind of
                related to sharing your journey on social media but basically when you are first
                starting your channel and you get those first few videos out you have this
                golden opportunity that you will never have for the entire life of your channel
                after that and that's that is new and fresh and people will be excited just
                about the fact that you're starting something new and starting something that is
                a little bit gutsy and a little bit unusual not everyone has their own YouTube
                channel<span class="orangecolor"> because a lot of people are afraid to speak on camera or they feel
                awkward about it</span> I mean people have lots of reasons.</p>
           
             <P>So, if you're actually stepping out and taking that step for yourself then a lot of people will be
                inspired by it and you can share it in that way with people So<span class="orangecolor"> make your launch
                into an actual event don't just kind of sneakily post your first couple videos</span>
                and almost hope no one sees them you know post those couple videos but then be
                leading up to it on social media even if your audience is tiny even if it really
                is just a couple hundred friends just lead up to it build whatever momentum you
                can and tell people like this is coming I'm working on starting my channel it's
                gonna launch on this certain date.</P>
                <P>So, that you can like I said build that
                momentum and actually get people excited about what you're doing.</P>

                <p class="text-warning">a) Tell your real life friends and family:</p>

                <P>Getting your first 100 YouTube subscribers this is to
                study people who are successful on YouTube who are in your same industry or your
                same niche so people who have channels that are like yours you need to become a
                student of their channels and really analyze what video ideas are working for
                them what seems to be resonating with their audience with their audience likes,</P>

                <P>So, that you can work on learning from what they're doing learning from what's
                working for them but also what's not working for them so that you can benefit
                from their success it's not about copying a specific video idea or even a
                specific topic necessarily it's certainly not about copying their style.
                </P>

                <P>
                    <span class="orangecolor"> You really need to be your own person and own your space and make your channel
                something unique</span> but you can still look at trends with what's working with them
                and I talk a lot more about this in my video called how I find viral video ideas
                for my channel obviously not every video on my channel goes viral but I have
                quite a number that have hundreds of thousands of views if not half a million
                views or even more and the way that I decided or the way that I found those
                ideas as video ideas wasn't just by thinking in my own brain you know like what
                would my subscribers really like it was a combination of me asking my
                subscribers what they wanted once I had subscribers but before that it was me
                looking at other people's channels and seeing what kind of content they were
                creating that their subscribers really seemed to like.

           <h3>5)FOCUS ON QUALITY:</h3>
               <p> <span class="orangecolor">Tip number five,</span> for getting those first 100 YouTube subscribers is to focus on quality
                    quality really matters there's so much competition online especially on YouTube
                    especially with new channels and if your video aren't very good quality then
                    it's gonna be really hard for you to stand out of course <span class="orangecolor">your videos don't need
                    to be perfect </span>and when you're first starting out they will be a little bit
                    awkward they won't be the best quality but you just need to continue to work on
                    that and work on making every single video better than the last one. </p>
           
             <P>That's because<span class="orangecolor"> if your quality doesn't improve then your channel probably won't grow </span>so
                    you need to keep working on figuring out how your video quality like the actual
                    image quality can get better how you can get better sound quality how you can
                    edit your videos better how you can make your thumbnails more interesting and
                    compelling there's many different ways that you can improve your videos and you
                    just need to constantly be on the lookout for what other people are doing better
                    than you so that you can learn from what they're doing and also watching your
                    own videos at least one time at the very least and seeing you know what problems
                    exist so that you can fix those and make your videos better.</P>

           <h3>6)make click worthy thumbnails:</h3>
               <p><span class="orangecolor">My sixth tip</span> is to make click worthy thumbnails I talk about this all the time and it's because it
                is so important but really whether your video has a good thumbnail or a bad
                thumbnail is going to determine how successful that video is at least it's
                probably the most important factor that will determine how successful that video
                is<span class="orangecolor"> you need to make thumbnails that look nice</span> and are eye-catching and make
                people interested and curious and make them want to click.</p>
           

                <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">

                 </div>  

             <P>YouTube is constantly suggesting videos to everyone who's on YouTube watching videos and when they
                suggest your video to someone that person will either choose to click on it and
                watch it or they won't and if they don't watch it then YouTube will think that
                they're not interested in it and YouTube then won't show that video to other
                people who are like that person who chosen not to watch the video.</P>
                    
                <P>On the other hand if that person goes and clicks on it and watches it then YouTube will think
                oh people like <span class="orangecolor">this person liked this video so YouTube will show your video
                suggest your video to a whole lot more people</span> who are similar to that one person
                who clicked on it and watched it and that's how you can really get traction with
                your channel whether you're first starting out after you have hundreds of
                subscribers or thousands of subscribers that's how it keeps on growing so focus
                your attention on making awesome thumbnails that really make people want to
                click invest a lot of time and energy and thought into making really awesome
                thumbnails.</P>

                <P>I normally use a free design program called canva, there's lots of other great options you can also use
                 fotor.com also free or you can use something like Adobe Illustrator or Adobe
                 Photoshop.</P>

               <p><span class="orangecolor">Tip number seven,</span> is super obvious and simple but so many
                people don't do it definitely kind of mention it and that is just ask people to

                hey subscribe to my channel for two videos every week</span> (or) I make new videos every
                week so make sure you subscribe to my channel it's amazing how much of a
                difference this makes if you simply ask people to subscribe and you give them a
                tiny reason why like there's more videos coming (or) I make videos about this
                specific topic.</p>

               <p><span class="orangecolor">My eighth and final tip</span> is simply to
                respect your numbers So I know that when you're first starting out and you only
                have 50 subscribers or you only have a hundred subscribers that you might feel
                just so tiny and like you can't compete with bigger channels at all but that's
                okay, really because when you think about it when you think about a room of 50 or
                a hundred people that's a lot of people really that's a lot of people to be
                sharing with that's a lot of people to have the attention of and it's an honor
                to be able to speak to any number of people even if it's only three people
                that's still three people who are giving you their attention and who are
                interested in what you have to share.</p>
           
             <P>So,<span class="orangecolor">really focus on giving your best to your
               subscribers</span>  even when there aren't very many of them focus on serving them
               really well figuring out exactly what they want and exactly how you can help
               them the very best or entertain them the very best whatever it is that you do on
               your channel and by doing that not only will you enjoy the journey so much more
               but your channel will also grow a lot faster,</P>

               <P>If you're really focused on giving
                and focused on being grateful for the people that you have rather than just you
                know having your eye on those bigger numbers and <span class="orangecolor">thinking you know someday my
                channel will be that big</span> and then it will be worth it it's worth it even if
                you're only reaching a couple dozen people.</P>
