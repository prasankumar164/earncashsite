     <h1 class="text-center">how my youtube channel earn $240,000 per year</h1>
     <p class="my-3">
        Why do I make Articles talking about how much money I make, well it's because it's
        awkward to talk about money and I just really enjoy punishing myself, okay not
        really right but talking about money is awkward and I think that that's
        something that we would all agree on personally I would love it if talking about
        money wasn't so awkward.
         </p>
         <p>So, let's jump into the topic,</p>
  </div>

<div class="container py-4">
  <p>I think that we could all help each other a lot more and
      we'd be able to learn more easily how to manage our money better if we talked
      about it more openly.
      </p>

      <p>So, the reason that I talk about money and the reason I talk
          about how much money I make is because talking about moneyis awkward but I
          think it shouldn't be so I'm trying to normalize it by talking about it here on
          my Articles.</p>

          <P>So, in this particular Article I'm gonna be sharing with you guys how my youtube
              channel manages to make around $240,000 a year
              and I'm so excited to give you guys this peek behind the scenes and share this
              with you because I think it is incredible that in this modern economy we are
              able to earn really good living is a really good salary annually from something
              like a YouTube channel.</P>

              <P>I just think that's incredible because in the old economy
                  people would have had to go to school for eight plus years to get a very
                  advanced degree so that they could get a really good job to be able to earn at
                  that level but these days there's so many alternative ways to earn a living and
                  I just think that that's so cool so I want to share with you guys how my YouTube
                  channel does that.
                  </P>

<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>1)Ad revenue:($50,000):</h3>
      
         <P>So, <span class="orangecolor">the first way</span> that my youtube channel makes money is
            probably the most obvious and the way that you already know that YouTube
            channels make money and that's through ad revenue when you watch my YouTube
            videos there are ads that are shown you know before the video starts maybe ads
            that are shown over there on the sidebar maybe ads that are shown in this little
            like banner section right here and whenever someone clicks on those ads the
            company who's running the ads pays YouTube money.</P>

            <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
              <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/1-AD-REVENUE.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Ad revenue:($50,000)" title="Ad revenue:($50,000)">
             </div> 

     <P>Let's say that Gillette
        wants to run an for their razors and so they put their ads on YouTube some of
        those ads show up on my video and on other people's videos and then if someone
        clicks on the ad someone who's watching the video clicks on the ad then Gillette
        would pay YouTube you know maybe a dollar two dollars five dollars somewhere in
        that range and then what happens if YouTube keeps half the money and YouTube
        actually pays the other half of the money to the Creator whose video that ad was
        shown on.</P>

        <P><span class="orangecolor">Which I think is such a awesome thing for YouTube to do </span>and you know
        they've created this amazing opportunity and platform for people to be able to
        create creative content and then get paid for it and that's just something that
        didn't exist just a few years ago you know just maybe 20 years ago there was no
        possibility of that and now someone can earn a full time living doing it and so
        to get back to how much money my YouTube channel makes from it.</P>

        <P><span class="orangecolor">Currently I'm making a little over about four thousand dollars from ad revenue</span> alone so it
            ends up being around fifty thousand dollars a year just from the ad revenue and
            if you want to see a breakdown of exactly how many dollars and cents I make in a
            few different months from that I revenue then check out my channel just click on
            my face down there and go to my channel and you can search for how much money
            does my youtube channel make or YouTube ad revenue and you'll find a couple of
            videos that I've made in the past about exactly how much money this is and how
            it all breaks down from like one video to the next and how much money I'm making
            on average per thousand views that my channel gets and all sorts of fun
            analytical stuff like that.</P>

                passive income and we have several hundred members in there right now and it's
                bringing in around a hundred and twenty thousand dollars per year in profit and
                my youtube channel is one of main ways that I advertise start society and tell

            something that I created so that I can make sales of it and that brings us right
            along into the next category of income that comes from my youtube channel and
            that is course sales so for the past couple years <span class="orangecolor">I've been creating online
            courses sometimes called courses and these</span> are training programs that people
            take online their series of videos and written lessons, PDFs that teach the
            students who purchase them something.
            </P>

            <P>For example, I have one all <span class="orangecolor">about how to
                start a successful YouTube channel</span> I have another course about how to get blog
                traffic Ivan out of their course about how to grow your email list and like I
                said I started creating these about two years ago and currently I'm bringing in
                around $40,000 per year from my course sales.</P>

                <P>I'm expecting that this part of my
                    business will be increasing over the next couple of years here but currently
                    it's at about $40,000 and just like with start-up society YouTube is my main
                    advertising platform for my courses this is where I get the best reach it's a
                    place where I don't have to pay for advertising.
                    </P>

                    <P>If I advertise my courses in another way say with Facebook guys or Google Ads then I have a large expense
                        that is eating into my profits that I make from the course sales but all the
                        sales that I make from youtube earn into direct profits.
                        </P>

   <h3>4)Affiliate marketting($10,000):</h3>
      
         <P>The next way that my youtube channel makes money and<span class="orangecolor"> contributes to my income is with
            affiliate marketing.</span>
            </P>

            <P>Now affiliate marketing is basically when you refer someone
                to a product and then you get paid a commission.</P>

                <P>So, <span class="orangecolor">for example if I told you what camera I use to film this video 
                  and I gave you a link to be able to buy it
                    on Amazon</span> that if you win and bought that camera on Amazon or actually if you
                    went in bought anything on Amazon after clicking on my link then I would get a
                    small percentage of that purchase price with Amazon it's about four to eight
                    percent but with some other types of products especially digital products so if
                    I referred you to buy someone else's course or something like that then the
                    Commission might be as high as 50%,
                    </P>

                    <P>So, here on my youtube channel there two
                        different ways that this plays out one is iron a small amount of money from
                        random things like mentioning what brand my camera is or mentioning a book and
                        from those things <span class="orangecolor">I earn those Amazon affiliate commissions </span>and that's just a
                        couple hundred dollars a month but then what generally ends up being
                        significantly more than that is when I heard four people two software so for
                        example I might share what hosting I use for my website or what software I use
                        for running my email list and the Commission's on those are higher and they're
                        often recurring so I get money from those every single month after someone signs
                        up and all told my income from affiliate marketing is around ten thousand
                        dollars a year.
                        </P>

                        <P>So, it's much less than some of those other sources of income but
                            it's still significant.
                            </P>

   <h3>5)private consulting($52,000):</h3>
      
         <P>The final category that I earn income from
            via YouTube is interesting because it's something that in the past I earned a
            fair amount of money from but going forward at least for this coming year I
            won't be earning much of any money from it and that is private consulting so
            working one-on-one with individual clients.            
            </P>

            <P>Now over this past year I earned around $50,000 working with these one-on-one clients some people I just worked
                with for one session other people<span class="orangecolor">I worked with for a month and then many others
                of them I worked with for 3 or 6 or 12 months.</span></P>

                <P>But I never worked with very many people at a time because I noticed that the more people 
                  I worked with the more I
                    was spending my time and energy building their businesses not having as much
                    time to focus on my YouTube channel and I'm building my business and that's why
                    I made the decision recently that at least for this coming year I'm not going to
                    be working with any new consulting clients I'm finishing up my contracts with a
                    few of my existing clients but I'm not going to be accepting anymore going
                    forward.
                    </P>

                    <P>Now that totally could change in the future maybe once I get to a point
                        with my business where I just I'm happy being like at a plateau or things are
                        spontaneously naturally growing then I might decide to go back to working with
                        one-on-one clients because it is something that<span class="orangecolor"> I really enjoy and I love
                        helping people in that way but for now it's something that I'm cutting out</span> so
                        I'm going to say that this is contributing zero dollars to my youtube income at
                        least going.
                        </P>

<div class="youtube-seo-main-heading">

     <p class="my-3">
        So, that pretty much<span class="orangecolor"> is a summary of the different ways that my
        youtube channel makes money about two hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year
        at the moment</span> of course it changes a lot for month to month that's about how
        much I earned over the course of the last twelve months and going forward I'm
        sure that it will continue to increase I'm very confident in that because it has
        continued to increase ever since I started it.
         </p>
         <p>Even though it doesn't increase every single month when 
           I look at the trend you know that line that's going up
            and down and up and down and up and down it is continuing on this upward trend
            so I hope that you guys enjoy kind of like hearing this behind the scenes of how
            my youtube channel earns money and like I said at the beginning the reason that
            I want to talk about money is because I think it's important that it isn't so
            awkward to talk about money and that we talk about it more. So that we can all
            better help to support each other in this way.</p>
