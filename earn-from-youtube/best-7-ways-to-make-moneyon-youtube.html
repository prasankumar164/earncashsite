   <h3>1)getting sponsorships:</h3>
       <p class="text-white">So, the first way you can make money with your YouTube channel is by <span class="orangecolor">getting
            sponsorships</span> now you might think that you need to have a whole lot of
            subscribers in order to actually get a brand to sponsor your videos but actually
            if your videos are really focused on a specific topic like, 

            <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
              <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/15-GETTING-SPONSORSHIPS.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="getting sponsorships" title="getting sponsorships">
             </div> 

             <li class="text-white">on pet care (or)</li>
             <li class="text-white">on homeschooling (or)</li>
             <li class="text-white">I'm cleaning your house {or}</li>
          </p> 

          <p>  on beauty then there are brands that will be interested in working with you even if you have 
                a really small audience because you're targeting the exact people who will be really interested in that
                company's products.</p>
   
     <P><span class="orangecolor">One place that you can go to find brand sponsorships is a
            website called Famebit</span> which works in partnership with YouTube and basically it
            just helps to connect influencers such as youtubers with brands who are looking
            to partner with influencers aside from using a service such as Fame bait you can
            also reach out to brands directly yourself and tell them why you think they
            would be such a good fit for your channel and how you could help them out.</P>
</div>
<span class="end"></span>

<div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
  <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/3-ATTRACT-CLIENTS.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Attract clients" title="Attract clients">
 </div> 

<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>2)Attract clients:</h3>
      
         <P><span class="orangecolor">The second way </span>that you can 
          make money on YouTube is to use your YouTube videos to
         attract clients for your business so if you have any sort of freelance skill (or)
         you decide to develop a freelance skill like become a photo editor (or) a web
         designer (or) a graphic designer (or) a virtual assistant.</P>

     <P>Then you can actually use
        your videos as a place to<span class="orangecolor"> advertise your services you can either do this right
        at the beginning </span>(or) the end by saying you know this video was sponsored by my
        company that does such-and-such (or) you can just make videos about topics that
        relate to the service that you provide and in that way show off to people that
        you actually know what you're doing you know what you're talking about.</P>

        <P>So, that they naturally are interested in hiring you.</P>

<div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
  <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/13-DIGITAL-PRODUCTS.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="selling digital products" title="selling digital products">

<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>3)selling digital products:</h3>
      
         <P><span class="orangecolor">The third way</span> that you can make
         money from your YouTube channel is the way that I make most of my income and
         that's by <span class="orangecolor">selling digital products,</span> digital products could be online courses or
         membership sites or something as simple as an e-book what is amazing about these
         products is that you don't have a per unit cost and so what that means is it
         doesn't cost you anything more to make ten thousand ebooks then it costs you to
         make that very first e-book.</P>

     <P>Once you put in the time and the effort upfront to
        <span class="orangecolor"> make a digital product to write an e-book (or) to create an online course </span>span of some
       sort then you can sell thousands of copies after it without having to do any
       more work or without having to store any sort of inventory.</P>

<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>4)affiliate marketing:</h3>
      
         <P><span class="orangecolor">The fourth way</span> that
          you can make money with your YouTube channel is by affiliate marketing now I
          know that if you have never heard of affiliate marketing before that might sound
          really complicated or like you've no idea what it is but actually all it means
          is that you're selling somebody else's product and you're using a special
          trackable link so you talk about a product in your video whether you're talking
          directly specifically about it or you just mention it as you're making a video
          about something else and then <span class="orangecolor">you put a link in your description to the product
          whether it's on Amazon or in some other site.</span></P>

          <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
            <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/2-AFFILIATE-MARKETING.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="affiliate marketing" title="affiliate marketing">
           </div> 

     <P>When someone purchases that
        product with your special link you get a cut of the profits as an affiliate for
        a product you can earn anywhere from about four percent all the way up to about
        75 percent.</P>

        <P>Typically for physical products like with Amazon you're gonna earn
         four to eight percent but<span class="orangecolor"> if you're selling digital products like if you're
         selling somebody else's online course then you normally earn 50% of the cost of
         the program the great thing about affiliate marketing</span> is that you don't actually
         have to make the product yourself it's really easy to get started with you can
         simply sign up for these affiliate programs normally there is no barrier to
         doing that they normally let anyone sign up and then all you have to do is
         mention the product in your video say something positive about it and put the
         link in your description and then you will make money from it.
        </P>

        <P>So, it's really
        easy of course it's also really important that you only promote products that
        you actually know are good products and preferably have personal direct with the
        product so that you can be sure that is a really good quality product.
        </P>

           <h3>5)sell merch:</h3>
              
                 <P><span class="orangecolor">The fifth way</span> that you can make money with your YouTube channel is to sell merch so
                  basically that means you can sell t-shirts or mugs or posters that have
                  something to do with your channel So maybe the t-shirt was just your channels
                  logo on it but more likely it's a t-shirt that has some Zara phrase that people
                  who watched viewer videos will get and they'll think it's funny or they'll be
                  proud to wear it for some reason or another.
                  </P>
        
             <P>So,<span class="orangecolor"> selling merch can be a really
              easy way to make money with your channel</span> because there are a lot of different
              services like merged amazon.com that allow you to just kind of fill out a form
              click a few buttons and then they'll actually make the merch for you and they
              will store it and they will ship it so you can just put links down in your
              description and sell this merch to your viewers on your YouTube channel.</P>

           <h3>6)crowdfunding:</h3>
              
                 <P><span class="orangecolor">The sixth way</span> that you can make money with your YouTube channel is through
                  crowdfunding now the most popular way that people are doing this these days is
                  through the website patreon and basically how this works is you ask people to
                  support you on patreon and then they will say that every time you do something
                  like every time you make an extra video they're going to give you a little bit
                  of money.
                  </P>
        
             <P>Now this isn't necessarily my favorite way to make money with your
              YouTube channel because I tend to be more entrepreneurial and more focused on
              giving people specific value and actually selling it to them and I don't prefer
              to just ask people to please give me money if I do something but instead to say
              I have this thing do you want to buy it that's just my personality<span class="orangecolor">the patreon
              does offer a really great platform for some specific types of YouTube channels
              like music or art focused YouTube channels</span>  because those things do lend
              themselves more to that type of support.</P>

                 <P><span class="orangecolor">The seventh way</span> that you can
                 make money with your YouTube channel is to monetize it with ads and I left this
                 one to last because I know that it's the one that comes to mind very first I
                 didn't wanted to start the video like that now personally my youtube channel
                 makes quite a bit of money from ads in order to make money with ads you do have
                 to meet certain thresholds like having at least 1000 subscribers and then
                 getting a certain number of views and certain number of watch hours on your
                 channel.
                  </P>

                  <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
                    <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/19MONETIZE-IT-WITH-ADS.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Monetize it with ads" title="Monetize it with ads">
                   </div> 
        
             <P>So,<span class="orangecolor"> you can't start making money with ads right off</span> the bat however if
            you follow good practices with starting your channel as I've covered in a few of
            my last Articles about how to start a successful YouTube channel then your channel
            should be able to grow and meet those thresholds pretty quickly.
            </P>

            <P>Once you do me those thresholds I think you'll be surprised at how much money you can make with
            ads <span class="orangecolor">youtubers make money when people actually click on the ads on their videos</span>
            but there are averages of approximately how much money you make per thousand
            views on your channel and those rates per thousand views vary anywhere from
            about $2 per thousand views all the way up to about 20 dollars per thousand
            views now personally on my channel I tend to make around ten dollars per
            thousand views which is a little bit more than the average Channel but it all
            depends on exactly which niche you're in on YouTube.</P>

            <P>So, exactly what your videos are about,
               who your audience is because that influences what types of ads 
               are shown on your channel So I make about ten dollars per thousand views on my
            channel and I know plenty of other people who also make a similar amount but <span class="orangecolor">it
            is a little bit more common to make closer to five dollars per thousand views.</span>
            </P>

            <P>Alright so that brings us to the end of these seven ways that you can make money
                    on YouTube. </P>
