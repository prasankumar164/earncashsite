           <p>
              If you are youtuber then of course you want your video is to rank well
              on YouTube but if you watched some of my previous videos then you know that you
              don't just want to rank well for search it's also so important that you get into
              those suggested videos over there in this ARTICLE I'm gonna explain to you how to
              tag your videos both to rank well in search and also to get into those suggested
              videos so that you can get the maximum number of views possible with every video
              the to me.</p>
  </div>


   







<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-3">
   <h3>1)tagging strategy for maximum views:</h3>
       <p>Well let's start
          out by talking about strategy because this is really<span class="orangecolor"> the most important part now when we are thinking about</span> what words we want to include in that tag section of
          your video description you first need to start by coming up with one main target
          keyword and you'll see this later on in the mistakes that people make that we
          talked about at the end of the video but one of those mistakes is that people
          kind of try to scattershot and try to hit all the different keywords that they
          possibly can but you have to think about the purpose of the tag section of your
          video.
          </p>
   
     <P>Really<span class="orangecolor"> the purpose of that section is to give YouTube more information
        about what your video is actually about</span> so that it can serve it to the right
        people it can show it for the right searches it can suggest it to the right
        people based on other things that they're interested in or based on what they're
        looking for and that means that in order to get the best results with your tags
        you need to keep them really clear and really focused so we start by choosing
        one main keyword that all the other keywords are going to complement.</P>


        <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
            <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/19MONETIZE-IT-WITH-ADS.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="tagging strategy for maximum views" title="tagging strategy for maximum views">
           </div> 

        <p>So, you
            might be wondering how do you decide what this keyword should be well there are
            two main factors that <span class="orangecolor">>I use when choosing the keywords for my videos </span>first of
            all I want the keyword to be very directly related to what the video is actually
            about I don't want to just go for something that's popular or that I think
            people might want to see but rather I want it to be a great match between the
            videos actual content and the videos title in the description and the tag.</p>

            <p>The reason that this is so important is because like I said before the point of the
                tags is to clearly tell YouTube what your video is about to give it more
                information about it and if you give that YouTube algorithm misinformation if
                you say this video is about funny casts then what's gonna happen well YouTube
                might try serving it to a couple people who are interested in funny cat videos
                and what are those people gonna do well they're not gonna click on your video if
                it doesn't look like it's about funny cats and if it looks like it's off any
                cats but they start watching it and it's not about funny cats well they're gonna
                click out real fast and if you know anything at all about how the algorithm
                works then you know <span class="orangecolor">that will really hurt your rankings and make it</span> so you
                definitely don't end up in those suggested videos.</p>

                <li class="text-white">So, rule number one, is that
                    your primary keyword is a great match with what your video is actually about and then.
                    </li>
                <li class="text-white pb-2">rule number two, is that it is a popular keyword that people are actually
                    looking for.
                    </li>

             <p>Now in order to figure out whether or not it is a popular keyword
                there are two main things that I'd recommend that you do,</p>  
                
                <p>The first is simply to
                    search for that keyword on YouTube and see what the average highest view count
                    is for videos that actually match that keyword so you search for funny cats and
                    what do you find will you find a bunch of videos that all have millions and
                    millions of views in fact every single one of the top five or ten search results
                    will have millions of views and that tells you that that is a really popular
                    keyword now of course you're not going to be using the keyword a funny cat
                    you'll use a keyword that is a great fit for your actual video but you can do
                    exactly the same thing to figure out whether or not<span class="orangecolor"> it's a popular keyword that
                    people are actually looking for.</span></p>

                    <p>The second thing that you can do is to
                        use a free extension called keywords everywhere so this is basically just an app
                        that you can install on your internet browser on your computer like I said it's
                        totally free no I'm not a sponsor it's free you can't be a sponsor but it will
                        really help you to figure out whether or not <span class="orangecolor">these keywords are actually popular.</span>
                        </p>

             <p>So, all you need to do after you've installed keywords everywhere is simply
                search for different keywords that you're considering making your primary
                keyword and keywords everywhere it will tell you exactly how many people
                searched that term every single month and you'll able to see which of those
                keywords that you're considering making your primary keyword is the very most
                popular,</p>      
                
              <p>All right so the first part of this tagging strategy is to find a great
                  keyword that's a good fit with your video and <span class="orangecolor">very popular to make your primary
                  keyword.</span></p>

       <h3>2)Put that keyword in all the right places:</h3>
           <p>The second part of the tagging strategy is to put that keyword
              in all the right places so first of all you want to make sure that you make it
              <span class="orangecolor">the very first tag in your video's description </span>and the reason for that is that
              YouTube does give more weight to the tags that come first and less weight to the
              tags that come later on so the tag that you want to be your primary keyword that
              you are really going after that you really want to rank really well for you need
              to make that the very first one and then beyond that and this is gonna go a
              little bit beyond just tagging but it's really important and really relevant so
              make sure that you use that primary keyword in your videos description at least
              once if not a couple times and also in your videos title you want to at least
              use most of the words from that tag in your videos title if not make that exact
              phrase your videos title or part of your videos title if it's a phrase that
              can't be part of your videos title then you might want to rethink whether or not
              that really should be your videos primary keyword that you're targeting because
              you'll be able to rank the best for a<span class="orangecolor"> target keyword </span>if you put it in the title
              description and the tag section,</p>
       
         <P>alright so so far you've <span class="orangecolor">picked a primary
            keyword </span>and you've put it in the right places in your video's description and
            tag and tail and now what should you do for all the rest of those tags well
            basically you want to pick tags that will complement that keyword and quite
            simply give YouTube more information about what your video is actually about.</P>

            <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
                <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/22-research.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Put that keyword in all the right places" title="Put that keyword in all the right places">
               </div>

            <P>we don't want to include tags just for the sake of including tags just to max out
                the allowed character count there we want to make sure that we include only very
                relevant tags that will actually give YouTube valuable information so that when
                they tried to suggest your video to someone based on those tags or they try to
                serve it as a search result based on those tags that it's actually a great fit
                for each of those search terms that you're<span class="orangecolor"> entering into the tag section </span>and
                when people see your video they click on it because that's gonna make it rank
                better and better over time.</P>

                <P>So, that's the basic strategy you pick a good
                    keyword you put it in the right place and then you add other complementary
                    keywords into your tag section but I know that right now you're probably
                    wondering well how do I figure out what those other complementary keywords are
                    to include in the tag section so that's what <span class="orangecolor">we're gonna get into in this second
                    part of the article </span>here is a little list of the different types of tags that you
                    should include with every video that you put out so first of all beyond that
                    primary keyword we also want to include several alternative keywords so these
                    are keywords that also describe your video that people also might be looking for
                    that are basically just different ways of saying that main thing that your video
                    is about or talking about different aspects of what your video is about. </P>

                    <P>So, for example, if you were making a what I eat in a day video then your primary keyword
                        might be healthy what I eat in a day but then some of your secondary keywords
                        those complementary keywords might be healthy eating or healthy recipes or what
                        I eat in a day or everything I eat in a day other keywords that also describe
                        what your videos about or some aspect of what your video is about and will give
                        YouTube more information now there's three things that you'll want to keep in
                        mind when you're thinking about<span class="orangecolor"> these alternative keywords </span>first of all you want
                        to make sure that they are logical and that they make sense and that they're
                        what people would actually search for if they were looking for a video like
                        yours.</P>

                <P>The good news here is that that's the easiest part for you to take care of
                    because you can just use your own brain and thank whom if I was looking for a
                    video like this what when I search for what would I type in to Google or type
                    into YouTube the second qualification is just that these alternative keywords
                    are a really good fit with your primary target keyword if they're way out in
                    left field like say maybe you were wearing a yellow shirt in your video so you
                    decide to throw in the keyword yellow shirt which doesn't really fit very well
                    with everything I eat in a day well that's not going to give the YouTube
                    algorithm very much clarity for who it should actually serve your video to or
                    suggest it to so it's just going to confuse the algorithm and will probably make
                    it so your video won't get suggested very much.</P> 
                    
                <P>So, you want to make sure second
                    qualification is that those alternative keywords are a good match with your
                    primary keyword and then the third qualification just like with that primary
                    keyword is that these alternative keywords are somewhat popular now it's okay if
                    they're not all insanely popular they don't all have to get millions or even
                    hundreds of thousands of hits every month it's okay to include some keywords
                    that<span class="orangecolor"> only get a couple hundred hits every month that's totally fine</span> because
                    really these keywords will still do their job and their job is to give YouTube
                    more information about what your video is actually about so that the algorithm
                    can suggest your video to people who actually want to watch it.</P>   
                    
                <P>The next type of
                    tags that you should include in your video's description are broad categories so
                    again just giving YouTube more information here if your video is about
                    everything you didn't date or exactly what you eat in a day well some of the
                    broad categories that that might be included in is recipes or cooking or healthy
                    eating sure those are big big categories and you might not rank for those
                    keywords but it still is going to give YouTube more information which will help
                    YouTube suggest your video to the right people.</P> 
                    
                <P>I hope that you're seeing a theme
                    here because that really is the entire purpose of the tags is just help the
                    algorithm recommend your video to the right people because that's what everyone
                    wants right that's what YouTube wants because that means that people will stay
                    on YouTube for longer if they're continuing to see content that they want to
                    watch that's what the viewers want because clearly I mean that's what they want
                    literally and that's what you want to because you want your videos to be shown
                    to people who actually want to watch them because <span class="orangecolor">those are the people who will
                    keep watching your videos over and over again</span> who will watch your videos for
                    long periods of time and who will actually subscribe to your channel.</P>

    <div class="container">
    <div class="seo-content my-3">
       <h3>3)Include in your video description is either your name or your channels name:</h3>
           <p>The <span class="orangecolor">final type of tag that I'd recommend that you include in your video description</span> is
              either your name or your channels name now at first you might think oh I don't
              need to do that I'll just skip that one because I'm new nobody knows who I am
              nobody is searching for my name on the Internet but wait because that's not
              actually the reason and now I mean sure that can help later on but the main
              reason why you should include your name or your channel's name is to get into
              the suggested videos the see here's the thing after someone watches one of your
              videos there's this special opportunity where maybe you can get them to watch
              more of your videos and you can get more views on your channel and you know
              potentially lay in that subscriber so what you need to do is make sure that that
              suggested up next video is one of yours and one of the best ways to do that is
              to add your name or your channels name to your video tags.</p>
       
         <P>Because then YouTube sees that those two videos the video that the person is watching right now and
            one of your other videos have something in common and quite possibly that's
            something that they have in common ie your name or your channels name is
            something that not very many other videos on YouTube have in common as well.</P>

               </div>

            <P>Alright so, far we've talked about tagging strategy we've talked about the
                different types of tags to include in every video and now let's get into just a
                couple tagging mistakes that a lot of new and not so new youtubers make they can
                really hold their videos back and prevent them from ranking well.
                </P>

             <P>The first mistake is,
                probably<span class="orangecolor"> the most common and that is to use the scattershot approach</span>
                and to use all sorts of different keywords some of which are not very relevant
                this goes back to that example that I used earlier where someone might use the
                keyword yellow shirt if they happen to be wearing a yellow shirt in their video
                now that example might be a little bit ridiculous but don't miss the point here
                the point is that you want to make sure that all of your keywords are focused on
                one specific topic one primary keyword you're not just using random keywords
                that you think might help a little bit when you do that when use that
                scattershot approach what happens is you just confuse the YouTube algorithm and
                then it doesn't know who to suggest your video to so you're not going to rank
                very well or get into those suggested videos.</P>
                
                <P><span class="orangecolor">The second mistake,</span> that I see people make sometimes is
                    to treat YouTube tags just like Instagram hashtags now
                   what I mean by this is that on Instagram if you want your pose to get seen by
                   more people then you might include hashtags that you know people who are
                   interested in your content in general tend to follow or might be searching for
                   so if you were treating YouTube tags like Instagram hashtags and your video was
                   about what you eat in the day then you might include a like clean-eating
                   motivation or fits po or something like that a tag that is basically a term that
                   someone might be interested in if they were also interested in your video
                   content but simply because of the way the YouTube algorithm works that really
                   isn't going to do any good people don't follow tags on YouTube the same way they
                   follow hashtags on Instagram and the like I have said a million times in this
                   video already the whole purpose of the tags is to give YouTube more information
                   about what your video is about and your video isn't exactly about those things
                   and people also aren't using those hashtag terms on YouTube so it's not going to
                   relate your video to the best suggestive videos.</P>

                   <P><span class="orangecolor">The third mistake, </span>that people sometimes make with their tags is simply to miss out on vital tags tags that
                      would give the YouTube algorithm really valuable information and help it know
                      who to suggest that video to so don't make this mistake don't include only about
                      3 tags and have one of them be your channel name one of them be the video title
                      and one of them be the broad category that your video is about.</P>

                      <P>Instead take the
                          time to do a little bit of keyword research either searching on YouTube or using
                          the keywords everywhere tool to<span class="orangecolor"> find keywords that people are actually looking
                          for</span> and are a good fit with your videos topic and will give YouTube that
                          information that it needs to show your video to people who actually want to
                          watch it. </P>
