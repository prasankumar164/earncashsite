    <p>
        Because if you're anything like me you probably have a lot of
        ideas a lot of great ideas for a YouTube channel but you can't get it started
        until you make a firm decision you pick one of them to move forward with so I've
        got a 5 step process that I'm going to walk you through that you can follow to
        find your best idea the idea that's really going to serve you the best so that
        you can get your channel off the ground.</p>
        <p>So, let's jump into the topic,</p>

</div>











<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-5">
   <h3>1)make a list of Ideas:</h3>
 
     <P><span class="orangecolor">The first thing</span> that you need to
        do is just make a list of all your different ideas because you probably have a
        lot of them floating around in the back of your head right now maybe there are a
        few that you're considering more strongly but something that could be holding
        you back from deciding exactly which one to pick could be those other ideas that
        you know are just on the back burner that you haven't completely written off.</P>
 <P>
    So, start by just making a list of all the different ideas that you might be
considering maybe it's - maybe <span class="orangecolor">it's 10 either way is fine once you've done that.</span></P>
 </div>
 <span class="end"></span>

<div id="main-seo-content">
    <div class="container">
    <div class="seo-content my-5">
       <h3>2)brainstorm video ideas:</h3>
     
         <P><span class="orangecolor">Step number 2, </span>is starting with the idea that 
          you're the most interested in
            brainstorm video ideas, Now the reason I want you to do this is because sometimes
            there's an idea for a channel that you think you're really interested in but
            once you start trying to come up with video ideas you realize that you really
            only have a few videos on that topic that you really want to make and beyond
            that<span class="orangecolor">you can't think of anything else to say about it.</span></P>

            <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
              <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/earn-five.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="brainstorm video ideas" title="brainstorm video ideas">
             </div>

     <P>
        So, start with the idea
        you're most interested in and start brainstorming video ideas I'd recommend that
        you come up with at least 20 video ideas that you are excited to make for that
        channel once you have come up with at least 20 ideas then move on to one of your
        other ideas now you might find as you're doing this that one of your ideas you
        come up with a whole lot of ideas for and the more ideas you come up with<span class="orangecolor"> the
        more excited you are for that idea.</span></P>

    <P>In that case you might just stop this
    process right here and <span class="orangecolor">just decide to go with that idea </span>but if that doesn't
    happen to you that's fine just keep going through your different channel ideas
    and coming up with video ideas and also if you come to a channel idea and you
    can't come up with a very many video ideas that's okay don't force it that
    probably just means it's not quite<span class="orangecolor"> the right idea for you right now the next
    thing that you need to do think.</span></P>
     </div>
     <span class="end"></span>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    






    
<div id="main-seo-content">
    <div class="container">
    <div class="seo-content my-5">
       <h3>3)Research those channel ideas:</h3>
     
         <P><span class="orangecolor">Number three,</span> is to research each of your channel
            on YouTube so you're just gonna search the main keywords or topics that each
            channel would encompass.</P>
     <P>
        So,<span class="orangecolor">for example</span> if you are thinking about starting a
        channel about baking desserts then you could start with that keyword, how to bake
        a dessert okay but you're probably gonna have some more specific keywords than
        that right like how to bake cupcakes (or) how to bake cookies easy cookie recipe
        you will know these keywords already because you've already made a list of video
        ideas so search for these different ideas you can search for the specific video
        titles that you came up with (or) just those keywords and see what you find see
        how many views videos in this t-shirt <span class="orangecolor">in this category are actually getting.</span></P>


        <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
          <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/10-COMMUNITY-LEADER.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Research those channel ideas" title="Research those channel ideas">
         </div>

    <P>Now <span class="orangecolor">you don't need to do anything with this information yet</span> but really you're just
      trying to compare each of your channel ideas to each other so you're looking at
      how many of yous cookie recipe videos are getting versus how many views
      eyeshadow tutorials are getting or you're looking for how many views video is
      about a certain video game that you like to play gets versus videos about your
      favorite hobby<span class="orangecolor"> you're trying to compare the different ideas to figure out.</span></P>

        <P>Which one is more popular and which one is less popular now that's not because you
        have to go with the most popular idea we're gonna get into this in just a minute
        we're going to talk about kind of your reasons why you want to start your
        channel and<span class="orangecolor"> how that might affect your decision of which channel to start</span> but
        right now you're just doing your research you're trying to figure out whether or
        not people are interested in these ideas so take some notes as you do this
        research write down the average number of views that the top video is in that
        category you're getting and anything else that stands out to you as you look at
        these keywords.</P>

     </div>
     <span class="end"></span>

       <h3>4)Why do you want to start a channel:</h3>
     
         <P><span class="orangecolor">The fourth step,</span> of this process of deciding what channel to start
            is just getting clear on the reason why you want to start your channel because
            there's a lot of different reasons why people want to start YouTube channels
            maybe<span class="orangecolor"> you're interested in being famous or making money</span> from the ads but maybe
            you just want to start your channel as a creative endeavor or an active
            self-expression or maybe you want to share with people a specific hobby or
            interest that you have that you are practicing or studying so you need to get
            clear on your reason why because that's going to have a huge and on which
            channel you should start if you're trying to make money with your channel then
            you need to make sure that you pick a topic that is really popular and that pays
            well on YouTube maybe you're trying to start a channel because you want to
            market a small business that you run so obviously we need to<span class="orangecolor">pick a topic that's
            related to what your business does.</span></P>

            <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
              <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/19MONETIZE-IT-WITH-ADS.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Why do you want to start a channel" title="Why do you want to start a channel">
             </div>

     <P>
        On the other hand if you want to start a
        channel that's simply about something that you love and you want to share then
        the popularity of that topic really doesn't matter you just need to pick the
        topic that you're <span class="orangecolor">the most interested in right now that you have the most ideas
        surrounding that you want to share </span>so that's why it's so important to get clear
        I'm your reason why and I'd really recommend that as you get clear on your
        reason why you keep asking yourself and why does that matter and why does that
        matter so for example if you think well really I want to start a channel because
        I want to make money okay well that's fine there's nothing wrong with that but
        then you have to ask yourself well why do I want to make money with my channel
        maybe it's because you don't like your job right now and you want to make money
        doing something that you really enjoy okay well why you know maybe it's because
        you want to find more satisfaction with your life or you want to<span class="orangecolor">spend your time
        on things that you really care about.</span>
        </P>

        <P>So, once you drill deeper in then that can
            help you to have even more clarity about which idea will be the right way
            because if I just say well I want to start a channel because I want to make
            money on YouTube well that could mean that lots of the ideas on my list could be
            the right one or could work but once I get really clear that it's because I want
            to spend my time doing something I love I know that I need to find an idea that
            will both be profitable but also is something I truly care about not just the
            thing that will make the most money and that leads us right into the fifth step
            you need to take a look at your ideas and a look at your reason why and you need
            to find<span class="orangecolor">the best match which one will really fulfill your reason why you want to
            start your channel.</span></P>

            <P>Now obviously I can't tell you which of your ideas you should
            start but I can tell you that by going through this process and by doing this
            research and by asking yourself these questions you'll be able to really figure
            out which one is going to be the best option now at this point you may not know
            which one you should choose you might feel like you still have some answers
            you're still debating between multiple ideas you're wondering if you should
            combine those ideas into just one idea so let me share with you three really
            important things to consider as you are making this decision.</P>

            <p class="text-warning">A)your YouTube channel does not define you:
              </p>

              <p>The first thing is
                  that your YouTube channel does not define you and it doesn't need to encompass
                  everything that you love if you're anything like me you probably have a lot of
                  different interests I think most people do they have a lot of different things
                  that they care about that they love there are parts of their lives and when
                  you're starting a YouTube channel especially if you're starting a channel that's
                  basically about you it can be really tempting to think that <span class="orangecolor">you need to
                  incorporate all those different things into just one channel.</span> </p>


            <p>So, if you like cooking and you have pets and maybe you have kids you think okay I need to talk
                about all those things all those things need to be a part of my channel because
                they're all important to me I don't want to leave any of them out but a channel
                is going to be the most successful most of the time if it's focused on one topic
                now of course we see plenty of examples of channels that are lifestyle channels
                where people bring all sorts of things into the mix but that really is the focus
                of that channel then it is a lifestyle Channel it's sharing a specific lifestyle
                and maybe it's serving as entertainment (or) really from boredom for its viewers
                but if your channel is gonna be focused on topics topic (or) multiple topics it's
                gonna do <span class="orangecolor">the best if it is focused primarily on one main topic.</span></p>

        <p>So, you're not trying to mix three different things together that don't really go together so
            you need to think about what that focuses is the focus your life or is that
            focus a topic something that you're interested in something that you want to
            share and if that's the case then please don't worry about the fact that you
            have other things in your life that you care about like<span class="orangecolor"> I said your channel does
            not define you it doesn't need to define you</span> it doesn't have to encompass all
            these different things you're a dynamic complex person with lots of interests
            but your channel will do the best if it's really focused.</p>

            <p class="text-warning">
                B)It's okey to pivot in the future:
            </p>

            <p><span class="orangecolor">The second thing</span> I want you to keep in mind as you're trying to make this decision is that 
                it's totally okay to pivot in the future you don't have to find the perfect idea right now
                it's okay if you start a little bit broad or if you start a little bit too
                specific you can widen your focus in the future or you can narrow it or you can
                pivot slightly it's okay to change of course we don't want to start a channel on
                one topic and then switch it to something completely different if you're doing
                that it's probably best to just start a new channel but it's okay to change your
                mind in the future it's okay to start a new channel or to change what you're
                doing so don't feel like you're locked in forever it's not a permanent decision.</p>

       <h3>5)you should know is that you'll be better off:</h3>
     
         <P><span class="orangecolor">The final thing </span>that I think you should know is that you'll be better off if you
            start anything now it's better to take action now and start moving forward than
            to wait for some day when you might have the perfect idea because honestly the
            perfect idea might never come and if you start something now you'll at least
            start getting practice having a youtube channel getting practice making videos
            having this channel will help you figure out what you really want to talk about
            and it'll just get you moving forward because three months from now you can
            either be three months into growing this channel or you will have figured out
            that this was the wrong idea and be able to cross it off your list or you will
            have started nothing and you'll be exactly where you're at right <span class="orangecolor">now I heard
            this really interesting story or quote.</span></P>
     <P>
        Recently where someone said I think this
        was on reddit they said I don't know if I should start pursuing a college degree
        because if I started today when I graduate I'll be 40 years old and I feel like
        that's like too late in life to do anything with my degree and someone responded
        and they said well if you don't start today in four years <span class="orangecolor">you'll still be 40
        years old but you won't have a college degree.</span></P>

        <P>So, I think it's kind of the same
            thing with starting a YouTube channel even if you don't have the perfect idea
            right now if you at least start then you'll start making progress you'll start
            learning you'll start growing you'll either move forward with that idea (or)
            you'll be able to cross it off your list but if you don't start then you won't
            be making any sort of progress at all.</P>

            <P>So, I hope that this process helps you to
                figure out which idea you should pursue but even if you're not quite sure yet I
                really just encourage you to move forward with<span class="orangecolor"> whatever you think you're the
                most interested in right now.</span></P>
