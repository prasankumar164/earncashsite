         <p>So, let's jump into the tips,</p>

</div>
</div>










<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-5">
   <h3>1)FIND GOOD KEYWORDS:</h3>
 <p>First, you need to understand that
     how YouTube decides which videos to rank is based on keywords. <span class="orangecolor"> People are looking
     for different topics on YouTube</span> and they're also watching videos and seeing
     videos suggested in the sidebar you need to use specific words that people are
     looking for or interested in your videos title, description and tags so that
     you will show up in the search and on that sidebar and more people will watch
     your video.</p>
     <P>The first step to doing this is to make sure that you find some
     really good keywords that people are actually interested in and actually
     searching for.</P>
     <div class="main-seo-img text-center">
     <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/youtube-seo-one.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="youtube seo ranking" title="youtube seo">
    </div>  
     <P>So, <span class="orangecolor">first, brainstorm a whole bunch of different ideas about what
      people might be searching for</span> think about the real words that people would use
      if they were looking for a video like yours after you've brainstormed a big list
      of words that people might be using then it's time to start doing a little bit
     of research to figure out which of those words are actually the most popular.</P>
     <P>The simplest way to do this is just to start typing these different keywords into
       the search bar on YouTube or on Google when you do this you'll see a bunch of
       suggested searches pop up and these are some of the things that people are
       searching for the most often when you find these terms that people are using the whole lot you'll want to make sure that you use those words in the title of your video title
       description and tags.
       </P>
       <P><span class="orangecolor">Another way </span>to figure out exactly <span class="orangecolor"> which keywords you should
       be focusing on </span>is to use a free extension called tube-buddy is just a
       browser extension that you can install on whatever browser you're using it will
       give you data on different search terms when you're doing research on YouTube so
       with tube-buddy installed when I search for a keyword on YouTube I see this
       little box pop up over on the side of the page and it gives me to rank for that
       keyword it tells me how good of a keyword that is based on how popular it is how
       many people are searching for it and how competitive it is.</P>
       <P>Basically you want to
       be looking for keywords that have lots of people searching for them but aren't
       very competitive now the reality is that most keywords that people are searching
       for are going to be fairly competitive so you're just looking to find a good
       balance <span class="orangecolor"> if you can find one that is moderately popular and moderately
       competitive</span> then that's actually probably a pretty good keyword to go after but
       ideally, you're looking for one that is very popular and not very competitive as
       your channel grows in popularity you'll be able to go after more and more
       competitive keywords and you'll be able to get better and better rankings for
       your videos.
       </P>
       <P>When you're just starting out it's better to target those less
         competitive keywords that maybe aren't quite as popular but at least you'll be
         able to rank for and start to get some traction on YouTube. </P>

<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-5">
    <div class="main-seo-img text-center">
        <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/USE-YOUR-COMPETITOR'S-VIDEO-TITLES-AS-TAGS.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="use your competitor's  video titles as tags" title="use your competitor's  video titles as tags"> 
        </div>
   <h3>2)use your competitor's  video titles as tags:</h3>
 <p><span class="orangecolor">My second tip, </span>is one that I haven't heard anyone talking about so if you do this you will
     definitely be ahead of the game and this is to use your competitor's  video titles
     as tags on your own video.</p>
     <P>So, when you're doing your keyword research and you're
     looking at these different keywords that you'd like to rank for and the sort of
     videos that if people are interested in them they would also be interested in
     the video that you are making.</P>
 <P>
     So, if you want to do is <span class="orangecolor">copy the title of that
     video exactly</span> and then paste it into the tags section of your video and also
     into the bottom part of the description of your video that way when someone is
     watching that video on YouTube your video will be much more likely to show up in
     the suggested video side column and you will get a lot more views because of it
     and if you want to be even more sneaky about it that you can open up a private
     the browser in your computer go to the competitor's  video and then see what videos
     show up in the side column when you're watching their video and you could use
     some of the more popular videos that are popping up on that sidebar as even more
     tags on your own video.</P>
 </div>
 <span class="end"></span>
</div>
</div>







<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-5">
   <h3>3)use TUBEBUDDY extension:</h3>
 <p><span class="orangecolor">Tip number three,</span> is to use TUBEBUDDY  to see what keywords
     your competitor's  are successfully targeting so whenever you're watching a video
     on youtube and you have TUBEBUDDY installed over on right hand side you will see
     a list of all of the tags that are on that video and tubebuddy will even tell
     you how well that video is ranking for those different tags.</p>
      <div class="right-youtube-seo my-2">
         <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/25-tube-buddy.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="youtube seo tips" title="youtube seo tips">  
        </div>
     <P>So, if you see a
       video that's really similar to the video that you're making and the channel that
      made it has a similar number of subscribers as you do and maybe their videos are
      doing about as well as your videos are normally doing then that gives you a good
      the idea that you can probably rank for those same keywords if you optimize your
      video around those keywords</P>
 <P>
     So, if you're making a video about how to train your
     puppy and you go and watch a video that has that tail how to train your puppy
     and <span class="orangecolor"> you look at the tags over on the side </span>and you see that they are ranking
     number five for the keyword puppy training tips then you know that puppy
     training tips are probably a good keyword for you to go after.</P>
 </div>
 <span class="end"></span>

<div class="seo-content my-5">

    <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/youtube-seo-two.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="seo for youtube" title="seo for youtube"> 
    </div>
   <h3>4)use your own name as a tag:</h3>
 <p><span class="orangecolor">Tip number four</span> YouTube likes to reward creators who keep people on YouTube
     for longer so when someone is watching one of your videos if they then go and
     watch another of your videos right after it then YouTube thinks oh wow this
     channel is doing a great job people are interested in watching more content and
     that means that they are interested in being on YouTube to watch this creators
     content.</p>
     <P>So, <span class="orangecolor">if you can do something to make people want to watch more of your
         videos</span> right after they watch one of your videos then YouTube will actually want
         to give you a boost in the rankings because they want your channel to do better
         so it sneaky little way that you can do this is to use your own name as a tag
         channel name in the tags section of your video.</P>
 <P>
     Here's what this does this means
     that YouTube thinks that your videos are even more closely related to each other
     because it seems that they have these different keywords that are in common so it
     sees that on one of your videos your name is in the tags and in another of your
     videos your name is in the tags and that way when someone's watching one of your
     video your other videos are even more likely to show up in those suggested
     videos <span class="orangecolor"> which means that someone is more likely to watch one of your videos after
     the video if they're already watching.</span></P>
     <P>So, not only does this mean that YouTube
         will favor your channel but it also means that you're getting more views right
         then and there because people are going to watch more of your videos in a row.</P>

   <h3>5)Place tags in tag box and in video description:</h3>
 <p><span class="orangecolor">Tip number five</span> is also kind of sneaky which 
     makes me feel like maybe I should
     call this Article like sneaky tips to rank number one on YouTube but anyway my
     fifth tip for you is to not only put the tags in the actual tags box where
     YouTube tells you to put your tags but <span class="orangecolor"> also copy them from there and paste them
     into the very bottom part of your video's description</span> and that way you get all
     of your keywords both into the description and into the tags also rather than
     trying to stuff all those keywords and make them sound natural somehow in the
     video's description.</p>
     <P>You can just put it all the way down at the bottom and just
     write tags and then put a whole list of the tags after that and that way anyone
     sees it they just think oh those are the tags and they won't think twice about
     it.

   <h3> bonus tip one:</h3>
 <p><span class="orangecolor">First bonus tip</span> is just making
   sure that you keep in mind that the main big picture strategy
  which is you want to find keywords that have a high searched volume and low
  competition the more of those keywords you can find the better your videos will do.</p>
   <h3> bonus tip number two:</h3>
 <p><span class="orangecolor">Bonus tip number two,</span>is decide exactly what keywords you're going to go
     after with your video before you film your video So, that as you make your video
     you can actually say the keywords in your video<span class="orangecolor"> because YouTube is listening to
     you their algorithm and software has gotten a lot more advanced </span>and they can
     actually listen to your videos now even if you don't have subtitles or closed
     captions on your video they can still listen to your video at least in part to
     try to figure out exactly what your video is about so if you say your keywords
     in your video of course in a natural conversational way then this will actually
     help your video rank better on YouTube.</p>
