          Today I'm gonna be explaining <span class="orangecolor"> how I turned my YouTube channel into a
          six-figure business in just about one year</span> now at this point I've had

          that now but it was right around the 12 month mark when my business

          process and the thing that I know you've already thought of is that in
          order to have a successful business based on YouTube channel You do
          have to have a somewhat successful YouTube channel in the first place

      <p>
            Before we really get into the strategy I just want to let you know that having a
            successful YouTube channel doesn't necessarily mean that you have hundreds of
            thousands of subscribers in fact there are way too many people out there who
            have half a million followers or more and are kind of struggling to pay the
            bills like they're not making very much money but on the other hand I know
            plenty of people who have 10,000 or 20,000 or 100,000 subscribers and they have
            very successful businesses I'm talking multiple million dollar businesses based
            off of a pretty small YouTube channel.
      </p>

      <p>
            So, it's not so much about how many followers you have it's much more about your business strategy which is exactly what we're going to be talking about in today's article okay so what exactly is my
            strategy well.             
      </p>

          <h3>1)GET VIEWS:</h3>

          <p>
              <span class="orangecolor"> The first step in the strategy is to get views on YouTube</span> because
                you do have to have that exposure something I say all the time is that nobody
                can follow you nobody can buy your stuff if they don't know you exist.
          </p>

          <p>
                We've all heard of the better mousetrap you know build a better mousetrap and the world
                will beat a path to your door but unfortunately 9 out of 10 times that's not
                exactly how it works you can build an amazing mousetrap you can have an amazing
                widget you can be amazing at what you do but <span class="orangecolor"> if people have never heard about
                you they won't even know that you exist</span> they won't know to find you they won't
                know to go out and look for you and so you really first have to focus on getting
                that visibility YouTube is an amazing place to get visibility so it starts by
                making good quality videos sharing helpful interesting information with people
                so that you start to actually get those views that you can convert into sales.

    <div id="main-seo-content">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="seo-content my-3">
          <h3>2)Build Trust:</h3>

          <p>
              <span class="orangecolor">The second important part of this strategy is to build a trust with my audience</span>
                so it's not just enough to get the views because someone watching your video if
                they don't trust you if they don't feel like they have any sort of relationship
                with you then the watch one of your videos or maybe even multiple of your videos
                and they'll never feel like buying anything from you or hiring you or even
                continuing to watch your videos long-term because you don't continue to hang out
                with people you don't have transactions with people you don't trust.
          </p>

          <p>
                So, three things that I focus on to build trust with my audience are 
          </p>
          <p><span class="text-warning">A)</span> First of all consistency both in consistently uploading videos regularly but also in my
               message you wouldn't really trust me if one day I said one thing and then the
               next day I said the opposite (or) was talking about a completely different topic
               okay so it's about consistency both in terms of time and consistency in your
               message</p>

        <p><span class="text-warning">B)</span> The second thing that I do to
           build trust with my audience is to give
        value okay I'm sure that you probably have watched daily vlogs before maybe you
        even love them and watch them on a regular basis but if the person isn't really
        giving you consistent value and you don't know for sure whether they have
        anything valuable to offer and so you might not buy their products <span class="orangecolor">because you
        don't know if they can actually help you with anything.</span></p>

        <p>So, if you want to build a business that actually is a very profitable business
           you're gonna need to
        offer some value in your videos and the third thing that <span class="orangecolor"> I do to build trust
        with my audience</span> is just to work continually on being as authentic and honest as
        I possibly can be trying to not hold anything back of course like there is
        always private life stuff you don't need to tell people everything but
        everything I do say I want it to be as authentic and real as it can possibly be
        because I just want you guys to know the truth about you know how my business is
        run and my life is really like I think that's way more interesting and more
        helpful to you guys and that's the way that I always try to live my life it
        works a lot better for building a trusting relationship with someone.</p>

                <p>
                        So, let's get back to my<span class="text-warning"> business strategy,</span>
                </p>

                <li class="text-white">first thing is getting those views,</li>
                <li class="text-white">second thing is building relationships with my viewers,</li>
                <li class="text-white mb-3">the third thing is establishing multiple points of connection,</li>
      
               
                <P>Now here's the thing if someone just watches you
                on YouTube then others think of you as oh yeah that's funny youtuber who I like
                to watch occasionally but<span class="text-warning">> if you want to really develop a deeper relationship
                with them and convince them that something that you have to sell</span> is actually
                something that can help them okay be that some sort of educational product or
                widget or simply more of their video content whatever it is that you want to
                give them in exchange for money you need to establish multiple points of
                connection you might have noticed before that there are people who you meet in
                certain places like.</P>

                <P>Let's say you're going to college and there are people who
                you meet at college you always see them in your French class okay and you know
                what their name is and you say hi you say how you doing stuff like that <span class="text-warning">it's all
                small talk but then once you see them in a different context</span> once you say hey
                you want to go out for coffee sometime or you even just see them at the mall and
                you stop to talk to them for a while once you have those multiple points of
                connection suddenly your relationship seems just a little bit deeper you seem
                like you know them a little bit better they feel like they know you better and
                it's much more likely that in the future you'll actually become friends.</P>

                <P>So, you'll want to do the same thing with our business we don't<span class="text-warning"> just want to talk to
                people on YouTube </span>but we want to establish multiple points of connection we want
                to tell them in our YouTube videos you could follow me on Instagram you could
                join my facebook group and also offer the viewers some sort of free resource or
                bonus content that they can subscribe to your email list in order to get now not
                only does this really deepen your bond with them but it also serves the purpose
                of making your business much stronger and more stable and more likely to
                withstand time and that's because YouTube or any other social media platform
                isn't gonna last forever and even if the platform continues to exist the fact is
                that something could and to your YouTube channel in fact I know multiple people
                whose YouTube channels have been accidentally deleted by YouTube.</P>

                <P><span class="text-warning">YouTube justlost their channel I also know people whose Instagram accounts have been either
                deleted (or) hacked (or) just they broke</span> so that they couldn't post anymore and it
                would be awful if you spent hours and hours and hours over the course of months
                and months and months building up your business building up your audience and
                they were all only on one platform and then you somehow lost that be so much
                waste of time I know it would be very upsetting so in order to overcome that I'm
                constantly working on establishing multiple points of connection with as many of
                my viewers as I possibly can.</P>

                    <p>
                        <span class="text-warning">The fourth step </span>in my business strategy is to
                    create a product that my audience actually needs and wants so often people make
                    things whether it's merch (or) an educational product (or) a software program (or) an
                    app (or) a widget whatever it is they make something that they think would be cool
                    (or) they think would have good profit margins (or) something like that but the fact
                    is that it's so, hard to sell things that people don't want it you have to try
                    so hard to be persuasive and<span class="text-warning"> even manipulative to convince people to buy
                    something but isn't something they actually want.</span>
                    </p>
          
                    <p>
                    So, <span class="text-warning">it's way easier to figureMout just what your audienc</span>e once and something thawould actually
                    be helpful to them and then work on creating that thing so that you could offer ito them
                    because that's gonna make you feel good and it's also gonna make them feel good
                    the fact that you're actually helping them and you're supporting yourself in the
                    process now since in this ARTICLE <span class="text-warning">I'm talking about how I turned my youtube
                    channel into a six-figure business.</span>
                    </p>

                    <P>I'll just let you know that in my case it's
                        <span class="text-warning"> through educational products </span>I create online courses and I sell them to my
                     audience to teach them how to do things that I've done in the past that I do
                     with my clients things like creating courses or getting blog traffic or running
                     Facebook ads I create courses that teach people how to do those things for
                     themselves and then <span class="text-warning">I also run startup society which is my membership community

                        <span class="text-warning">  The fifth part of my business strategy is</span> perhaps
                    the simplest and it's just to show my audience how they can benefit from the
                    products that I've created, because I've Curie hated these products based on the
                    idea that this is something that my audience actually wants something that would
                    be helpful to them and so now I basically just have to show them how the product
                    works.
                    </p>
          
                    <p>
                    I have to show them the behind the scenes of creating the course and
                    everything that's going into it I have to show them what's actually in the
                    course give them a walk through and it also have to show them the results that
                    whatever this thing is that<span class="text-warning"> I'm teaching them has created in my life.</span> 
                    </p>

                    <P><span class="text-warning">For example, </span>my course that's all about how to 
                      get blog traffic I need to show people
                             how getting more blog traffic has impacted my life and also how I've managed to
                            get the blog traffic and when I show them kind of what I did to get the blog
                            traffic and then how that impacted my life then it shows them that this product
                            actually works and that it will actually be worth the price that I'm charging
                            for it okay so that basically is my business strategy and I know that there's
                            not a whole lot to it but<span class="text-warning"> I try to keep things as simple as possible because
                            it's more important</span> about doing the simple things right than it is about making
                            this super complex.

                            down to just three main puzzle pieces. </P>
                            
                            <P>So,<span class="text-warning"> the first part </span>is actually getting the views on YouTube,
                                </P>
                     
                  <P>The <span class="text-warning">second thing </span>is establishing trust with that audience,</P>   
                  
                  <P><span class="text-warning">Third </span>I want to create more points of connection to deepen my relationship and to make
                        my business stronger and more solid,</P>

                        <P><span class="text-warning">fourth and this is so important</span> is coming up with a product that my audience actually wants and it will actually be helpful to them,</P>

                        <P>the <span class="text-warning">final thing</span> is just showing them how the product works.</P>

                 <P>what results it can produce for them okay but now let's talk about kind of what
                 this all boils down to you because even if you don't build your business than
                 exactly that order there are still three main things that you need to make sure
                 that you're working on in order to increase your profit and grow your business
                 bigger and better first of all you've got to create interesting high quality
                 valuable content and I really mean all of those things individually interesting
                 if it's not interesting<span class="text-warning"> then people aren't gonna keep watching it they're gonna
                 get bored they're gonna turn it off.</span></P>


                 <P>second of all high quality okay I'm talking
                 about <span class="text-warning">the technical quality, here having good video quality, good audio quality</span>
                 good lighting good editing okay because there's so much competition out there
                 that if your content isn't pretty good quality then people are gonna go and
                 watch something else.</P>

                 <P>Then the third thing is valuable okay if people are not
                 going to spend their time on your content if it is just a waste of their time
                 and you might say well you know there's this daily vloggers out there so there's
                 people who don't have educational YouTube channels and they're doing great and
                 that's very true and that's because they are offering a different kind of value
                 <span class="text-warning"> they're offering the value of entertainment.</span></P>

                 <P>So, if you happen to be funny or be
                really good at having a really interesting story then you might be able to add
                that entertainment value to people's lives on the other hand you might choose to
                have a YouTube channel more like mine where I'm focused more on the value of
                practical instruction and knowledge and like sharing stuff with you guys that is
                really important to me and has helped me in my life and has helped me grow my
                business but long story short that first component is to create interesting high
                quality valuable content so <span class="text-warning">that people actually watch your content and are
                interested in paying money for more of it.</span></P>

                <P>The second thing is you got to get
                visibility people have to actually watch your videos you need to create
                connections with other people you need to maybe use paid advertising or do
                collaborations with other people so that your channel gets to be more visible
                and <span class="text-warning">that goes whether you're building a 
                  YouTube channel (or) a vlog</span> (or) any other
                sort of online platform you got to get visibility in order for people to find
                out about your awesome content.</P>

                <P><span class="text-warning">Then the final thing </span>is just to kind of
                connect those two things you've got this awesome content you're getting the
                visibility and now you need to strategically guide your audience toward getting
                the result that they desire so whether that is to get more entertainment value
                or that is to learn some specific skills or that is to increase their income
                okay whatever it is that your audience really wants you need to guide them
                toward purchasing your product that helps them get that result. maybe that
                means they become a supporter of your channel to get more videos every single
                week maybe that means that they purchase your educational online course maybe it
                means they buy your widget that will help them in some way whatever it is in
                order to turn your YouTube channel into a business you somehow have to show them
                something they can buy so<span class="text-warning"> that you can create profit and they can get that value
                in their life.</span></P>

                <P>Okay, so long story short how did I turn my YouTube channel into a six-figure business.</P>
