        </h1>
     <p class="my-3">
            Over the years as you continue to watch youtube videos you might have decided
            that you're interested in starting your own channel but she also may be a little
            bit worried that it's too late maybe you'll feel like you've missed the boat
            because of course YouTube has continued to grow and there continue to be more
            and more creators on the platform there are now millions of creators here and
            millions upon millions of videos and so you might feel like making videos of
            your own will just be a waste of time.

     <p>Because how will they ever get found so in
        today's article I wanted to talk about some different things that you should
        consider if you're thinking about starting your own channel and whether or not
        it's too late at this point to start a channel whether there's still the
        opportunity to be successful here to get the subscribers to get the views on
        your videos and later on in this video I'm also going to talk about ads and how
        ads are paying these days whether they pay better or worse than they used to pay
        and all those different things to help you make this decision.

<div id="main-seo-content">
<div class="container">
<div class="seo-content my-5">


    <p>Because of the way
        that YouTube works and the way people consume YouTube videos and interact with
        channels I believe that there is always going to be room for new creators,
        here's why,</p>

        <P>Channels thrive by building communities they attract subscribers that are
            interested in what they're talking about and interested in their point of view
            and then those people continue to watch their videos and leave comments sure
            some views come by people randomly finding videos of via search but the majority
            of views come from YouTube suggesting content to viewers and then people
            subscribing to those channels and following along with the channels and I here's
            what I think you should keep in mind even though there are more channels on
            YouTube year after year and specifically there's new channels on YouTube year
            after year some of the old channels died away.</P>

            <div class="main-seo-img text-center px-4">
              <img src="../img/earn-with-youtube/19MONETIZE-IT-WITH-ADS.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="tips for starting a youtube channel" title="tips for starting a youtube channel">
             </div>

            <P>Sometimes creators stopped posting
                videos or they have their subscribers lose interest in the videos that they are
                creating and that means that there's always room for new blood coming into
                YouTube the other thing you should think about is that the who are watching
                these videos their interests are changing these are real people who are growing
                and have evolving tastes you aren't interested in exactly the same thing that
                you were interested in a few years ago so as you think about the millions of
                people who use YouTube and watch videos here don't think that they all have
                already found everything that they want to watch as each of those people is
                continuing to grow and change they're always going to be looking for new videos
                that are interesting to them based on who they are becoming and so for that
                reason YouTube can really never become saturated with creators now yes
                eventually YouTube will pass away it will lose popularity some other social
                media platform will become the giant of the industry people will stop watching
                YouTube but that certainly isn't happening yet,</P>

                <P>YouTube is continuing to grow in
                    popularity every single year so you certainly haven't missed the bandwagon
                    another thing to keep in mind aside from just that people are changing and
                    looking for new things is that your videos are not going to be the same as
                    what's already out there,</P>

         <P>There are so many different ways that creators
            differentiate themselves just naturally without even trying first value of the
            specific topic you're talking about if you do a search on youtube you'll
            probably find that there is a relatively small number of people who also talk
            about that exact topic and then beyond that it's not just the topic but it's
            your angle on the topic how are you approaching the topic.</P>  
            
        <P>Then beyond that
            we've got your take on the topic so we have what you're talking about how you're
            talking about it and then your opinion on everything that you're saying and then
            beyond that we've got your personality and everything about you what you look
            like how you sound the vocabulary that you use all of that goes into making your
            video and your channel completely unique and that means that it's relatively
            easy to differentiate yourself from your competitors.</P>  
            
          <P>So, those are just a
              few reasons why YouTube isn't saturated but let's also talk about how
              challenging YouTube really is this is another reason why you don't need to be
              afraid of the competition now I'm not going to say that YouTube is really
              difficult or that there's only a few people who can do it or anything like that
              but it definitely takes some real effort some dedication commitment with your
              time you need to do planning you need to be somewhat creative and there needs to
              be some passion behind what you're doing because first of all that passion will
              come across in your videos and people will watch your videos more if you have
              that passion but second you're not gonna stick with it if you don't have any
              passion behind what you're talking about or the videos that you're creating so
              you put all those things together and what you find is that YouTube is somewhat
              difficult and because of that in any given particular niche here in YouTube
              there's not very many different channels that actually make good videos.</P>

              <P>So, sure there might be a lot of videos on YouTube that use some of the keywords that you
                  want to talk about but most of them probably aren't very good and the more you
                  did the more you'll discover that but here's the good news the YouTube algorithm
                  is there to help you out if you make videos on topics that people are interested
                  in watching videos on and your videos are better than the competition's videos
                  then YouTube will push your videos to the top YouTube will suggest your videos
                  to people who are interested in those topics and that means that you fortunately
                  don't have to do all the work of trying to stand out from your competition
                  trying to get seen the algorithm does that work for you.</P>

             <P>This year more than
                any other year the algorithm is better than ever and that's really more true
                this year than any other year because as the YouTube algorithm has continued to
                improve it has gotten better and better at pushing the best videos to the top so
                it used to be the video sometimes win viral randomly but now it's pretty
                predictable if you make a good video on a topic people are interested in more
                likely than not given a little bit of time the algorithm will work its magic and
                your video will take off and that means that now it's relatively easy to grow a
                successful channel on YouTube and not only that but you predict the growth of
                the channel that's making good videos on topics that people are interested in so
                like I said before one of the ingredients that's necessary for making good
                videos and being successful in YouTube is to have that passion to really care
                about what you're talking about or really care about making videos and I have to
                say that you can build a successful channel on almost passion alone now it's not
                just because you care about it but it's because what caring about it makes you
                do.</P>     

                <P>If you really care about the videos you're making and you really want to be a
                    successful youtuber then you'll bring it you'll work on your video quality
                    you'll make better and better videos you'll figure out ways to make your videos
                    more interesting and you'll be consistent so if you really want to be a
                    successful youtuber then go for it because you'll find that if you really wanted
                    it will actually be surprisingly easy I know I said that YouTube is difficult
                    but the less you care about it the more difficult it is the more you care about
                    it the easier we'll see now one thing that I do want to warn you of before you
                    even get started is that whenever you first start your channel whether you start
                    it now or you started a year from now or even if you hadn't started it several
                    years in the past whenever you started that channel at first it will probably
                    feel like it's not working like it's not going anywhere and that's just because
                    it takes time at first your videos won't be very good probably but over time
                    they'll get better and better and better and so the algorithm will promote them
                    more and more it also just takes time for the algorithm to figure out who is
                    interested in your videos so even if your videos were amazing right from the
                    start the algorithm will have test it against different essentially profiles of
                    people people who are different ages people who have different interests people
                    who have watched different videos in the past before it starts to find a pattern
                    of who likes your videos and that's when your videos will really start to take
                    off and go viral that's when the algorithm will really start pushing them out
                    there.</P>

                    <P>I've had many many videos that long after I made them win viral in fact
                        the very first video on my channel  when I first made it it only got a few
                        views out of the gate but then about six months later it took off the algorithm
                        figured out who is interested in it started suggesting it to people and it went
                        on to get hundreds of thousands of views alright so now you understand why
                        YouTube isn't as competitive as it seems and what it really takes to stand out
                        and what to expect when you start your channel.</P>

              <P>There's two more things I
                  want to share with you before we wrap this article up the,</P>     
                  
             <li class="text-white mb-2">
                first one is I want to
                talk about ads how ads pay do they pay better or worse than they used to pay is
                the money that you make from ads really worth it, 
             </li>     
             <li class="text-white mb-2">
                then a second I'm going to
                share with you one of my number one tips for standing out on YouTube and really
                succeeding as a YouTube creator.
             </li>     

             <p>So, ads real brief history lesson here ads
                used to pay pretty well here on YouTube and then a couple of years ago there was
                this big thing that happened that people called ad pocalypse basically a bunch
                of YouTube's advertisers YouTube's biggest advertisers got upset with how some
                of their ads were being shown on YouTube and they all called their ads from
                YouTube which was a big problem for YouTube because YouTube really relies on
                that advertising money to stay in the green and to be able to continue to
                operate so that caused YouTube a big problem that they needed to solve very 
                quickly so they ascend Sherly blacklisted a whole bunch of keywords, keywords
                that could be in videos in videos descriptions and videos titles that the
                advertisers might find offensive which meant that a lot of videos got 
                Demonetized like I said this happened a couple years ago and when it happened many
                many big youtubers ad revenue severely was cut I'm talking cut by sixty or
                seventy percent or even more and so youtubers that were relying on this for
                their primary source of income had a big problem on their hands.</p>

                <p>Now ever since
                    then YouTube isn't working on improving their algorithm for determining which
                    videos are suitable for advertisers and at this point it actually works very
                    well and there are very few categories of videos that can't be monetized and
                    it's very easy to understand YouTube's guidelines as to which types of videos
                    will be eligible for monetization versus which won't be and so most YouTube
                    creators are just fine and they're able to make good money from those ads for
                    reference most youtubers earn somewhere between $1 and 20 dollars for every
                    thousand views that their videos get so if they make a video and it gets 1,000
                    views they might earn anywhere between $1 and 20 dollars most YouTube creators
                    are earning between five and ten dollars my channel happens to be on the
                    slightly higher end of that I tend to earn a little over ten dollars per every
                    thousand views that my videos get and have to say that over the past
                    two-and-a-half years that I've had this channel my ad revenue has done nothing
                    but go up I've continued to earn a little bit more and a little bit more per
                    thousand views.</p>

               <p>So, of course my channel has also gotten more and more views over
                  time but I've also earned more per view and I think there are a few reasons for
                  that one is because there's actually a little bit less competition than there
                  used to be before I pocalypse because before apocalypse YouTube put ads on all
                  the videos there were very few videos demonetised most of them that were were
                  only demonetised for copyright reasons so now that it is a slightly more curated
                  group of videos that can be monetized there's a little bit less competition so
                  you can earn a little bit more.</p>    
                  
                  
                  <p>Now right after I'd pocalypse people did earn
                      less because there were fewer advertisers but now that most of the big
                      advertisers have come back and YouTube has overcome this problem with their
                      advertisers there are more advertisers than ever who want to advertise on
                      YouTube so they're willing to pay more for YouTube ads.</p>
